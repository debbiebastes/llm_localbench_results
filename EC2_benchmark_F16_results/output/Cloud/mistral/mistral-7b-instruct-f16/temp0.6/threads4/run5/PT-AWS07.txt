A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day. 

This solution is operationally efficient as it allows the organization to proactively scale up their application resources before the demand increases, ensuring that the application performs optimally at all times. By configuring a scheduled scaling policy, the organization can ensure that there are enough EC2 instances available to handle the traffic during peak usage hours. Additionally, this solution is less reactive than other options such as predictive or dynamic scaling policies, which may take time to adjust to changes in demand.
