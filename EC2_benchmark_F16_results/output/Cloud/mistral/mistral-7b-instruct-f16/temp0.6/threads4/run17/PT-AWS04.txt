Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

To achieve optimum performance, we need to determine the number of KCL workers required per shard. Since each instance runs one KCL worker, the optimal number of instances would be equal to the number of shards. Therefore, the number of EC2 instances required is 6. Answer (D) is correct.
