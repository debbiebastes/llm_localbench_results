A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

A Security Engineer should implement Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key (Option A). This ensures that the data is encrypted before it is uploaded to the S3 bucket and can only be decrypted by an authorized client or application that has access to the client-side master key. 

Option B would not comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company as the KMS-managed customer master key would be sent to AWS for management, which is against the company's policy. Option D would also not comply with the company's policy as it would require providing the client-side master key to AWS for server-side encryption, which is also against the company's policy.

Option C would comply with the company's policy as it does not send any sensitive PII or client-side master keys to AWS for management and decryption, but it may not be the most secure option as the data is encrypted on the server side, which means that if an attacker gains access to the S3 bucket, they can still read the unencrypted data.
