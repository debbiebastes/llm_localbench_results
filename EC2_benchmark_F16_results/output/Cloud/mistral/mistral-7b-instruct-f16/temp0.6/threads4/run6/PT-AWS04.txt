Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

To determine the maximum number of EC2 instances required, we can consider the following factors:

* Each instance runs one KCL worker.
* The number of open shards in the Kinesis data stream is six.

Since each KCL worker processes one shard at a time, we need to launch a minimum of 6 EC2 instances to handle all the shards. Therefore, the answer is (D) 6.
