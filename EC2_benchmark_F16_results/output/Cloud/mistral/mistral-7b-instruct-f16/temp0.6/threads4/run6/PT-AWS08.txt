An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

To meet the above requirement, we suggest you choose option (C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.

The persistent block storage volume can be created using EBS volumes which are designed for mission-critical workloads. The EBS volume will provide high availability, durability, and performance compared to instance store volumes. 

By storing backup data in Amazon S3, you can ensure long-term retention and disaster recovery capabilities. Additionally, by configuring a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA after 30 days, you can reduce storage costs and optimize your storage for infrequently accessed data.

Option (D) is incorrect as it suggests storing backup data in Amazon S3 One Zone-IA instead of Amazon S3 Glacier which is a more cost-effective option for long-term retention.
