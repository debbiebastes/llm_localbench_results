Answer: 

For a company that wants to migrate its on-premise infrastructure to Amazon Web Services, the Operations Perspective would be the most essential. This perspective focuses on automating and orchestrating processes across different stages of cloud adoption, ensuring an efficient and secure migration process. It also includes best practices for managing the cloud environment, which is crucial for a successful migration. The Security, Governance, and Platform perspectives are important but come after the Operations perspective has been established.
