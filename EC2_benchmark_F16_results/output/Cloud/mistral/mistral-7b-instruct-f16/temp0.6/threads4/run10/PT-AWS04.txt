Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

To determine the maximum number of EC2 instances required to process a Kinesis stream with six shards, we need to consider the number of open shards and the number of worker instances per shard. Since each instance has one KCL worker, the maximum number of EC2 instances that can be used is equal to the number of shards, which is six. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 12.
