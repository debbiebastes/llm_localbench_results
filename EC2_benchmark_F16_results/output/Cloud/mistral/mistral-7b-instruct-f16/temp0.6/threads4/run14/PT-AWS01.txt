A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

AWS recommends using option (B) to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. This will ensure that the sensitive PII data is stored in an encrypted format in AWS S3, and the master key used for encryption is managed by AWS Key Management Service (KMS), which is a fully-managed service that makes it easy to create, manage, and use encryption keys securely. By using this technique, the hospital can be assured that their data remains compliant and secure in AWS S3.
