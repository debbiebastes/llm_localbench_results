Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

B. 12

Explanation:

To achieve optimal performance when processing a Kinesis data stream with six shards, you should launch 12 EC2 instances - one KCL worker per shard. This will ensure that each shard is processed independently and efficiently by its dedicated KCL worker, resulting in maximum throughput and minimal latency.
