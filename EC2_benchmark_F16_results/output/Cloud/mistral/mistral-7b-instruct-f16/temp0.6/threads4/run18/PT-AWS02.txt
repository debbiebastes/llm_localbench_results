The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

The most suitable solution in this scenario is (A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes. 

Explanation: 

- AWS Systems Manager Session Manager allows for remote management of EC2 instances, including patch deployment. This solution is particularly useful when the instances are spread across multiple regions or availability zones. 

- Amazon QuickSight can be used to create reports and visualizations on system performance, configuration changes, and compliance statuses. The integration with Kibana allows for easy management of logs and audit data. 

- This solution is also more comprehensive than simply deploying patches using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager or configuring the instances to automatically install patches on a weekly basis. It includes remote management of the instances, patch deployment, configuration tracking, and compliance reporting all in one solution.
