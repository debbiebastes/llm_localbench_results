A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation: 

Option (A) is not recommended as it requires the client-side master key to be sent to AWS, which violates the security requirements of the company.

Option (C) is also not recommended as it encrypts data at the server-side and sends it back to the client, which can expose the data to potential attacks if intercepted.

Option (D) is not recommended as it allows the customer to manage their own key, which can lead to a loss of control and potential security risks.

Option (B) is the most secure option as it encrypts data at the client-side using a KMS-managed customer master key, which ensures that no unencrypted data is sent to AWS or exposed in any way. This option also provides the customer with full control over their own encryption keys, while still allowing them to comply with strict compliance and regulatory requirements.
