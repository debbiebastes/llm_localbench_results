A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling. 

While option (B), enabling throttling limits and result caching, can help mitigate some of the traffic, it may not be enough for a significant spike in site visitors and new users. Option (C) using CloudFront as a cache may also help, but again may not be sufficient for a sudden increase in traffic.

Option (D) moving the Lambda function in a VPC is a good practice for security and performance, but it doesn't directly address scalability issues.

The best approach would be to switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling. This way, the platform can handle sudden spikes in traffic without overloading its backend systems. Additionally, this architecture can provide better performance, security, and reliability for the trading platform.
