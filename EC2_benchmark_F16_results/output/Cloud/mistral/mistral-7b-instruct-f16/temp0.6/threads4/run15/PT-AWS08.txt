An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

For mission-critical workloads, it is recommended to use block storage volumes that provide high availability and durability. Therefore, the correct option for meeting the above requirement is (A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance.

In addition to using Amazon S3 as a backup storage, you can use Amazon S3 One Zone-IA or Amazon S3 Glacier to optimize storage costs based on your access patterns and recovery point objectives. Amazon S3 One Zone-IA provides faster retrieval than Amazon S3 Glacier for infrequently accessed objects while Amazon S3 Glacier is suitable for long-term data archiving.
