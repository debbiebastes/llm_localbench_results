A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

The correct option is (B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation: 
In this scenario, the Security Engineer needs to ensure that the master keys and unencrypted data are never sent to AWS. One way to achieve this is by using Amazon S3 client-side encryption. However, since the master keys need to be securely managed, it's recommended to use a Key Management Service (KMS) managed customer master key instead of a client-side master key. This will ensure that the master key remains within the company's control and is not sent to AWS. Additionally, Amazon S3 server-side encryption with KMS-managed key also provides an extra layer of protection by encrypting the data at rest in the S3 bucket. Therefore, option (B) is the correct choice for this scenario.
