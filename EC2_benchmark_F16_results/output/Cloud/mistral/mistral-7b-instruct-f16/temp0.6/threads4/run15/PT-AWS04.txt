Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(B) 12

Explanation:

To achieve optimum performance, you need to ensure that each KCL worker is assigned to one shard. Since there are six shards, and each instance can have one KCL worker, you should launch a total of 6 instances. This will ensure that each worker is assigned to one shard, and you can achieve optimum performance.

Hence, the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance is 6.
