A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

Option B - Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

This option is preferred as it provides end-to-end encryption of the data at rest while still allowing access to the unencrypted data via the S3 client. The customer can generate their own master key, which they keep securely, and use it to encrypt and decrypt the data in the S3 bucket. This ensures that the data remains confidential and secure while adhering to strict compliance and regulatory requirements.
