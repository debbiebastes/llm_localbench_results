The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The most suitable solution in this scenario is (C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager is a managed service that automates patch management across Amazon Web Services resources, including EC2 instances. It provides a centralized location for managing software updates, with built-in compliance reporting features. With this solution, the IT team can easily deploy patches to the outdated EC2 instances, ensuring that all systems are up-to-date and secure.

Additionally, AWS Config is a fully managed service that enables users to monitor and track configuration changes across their AWS resources. It provides detailed information about resource configurations, including when they were last modified and who made the change. This can be helpful for auditing purposes and ensuring compliance with internal and external regulations.
