Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12

If you reshard the Kinesis stream to six shards, then each instance should have one KCL worker. Hence, for six shards, you would need at least six instances with one KCL worker per instance. In this case, if each worker processes a portion of the data stream, they can process all the data streams in parallel without any bottleneck, and hence the maximum number of EC2 instances required to achieve optimum performance is 12 (6 shards * 2 workers per shard).
