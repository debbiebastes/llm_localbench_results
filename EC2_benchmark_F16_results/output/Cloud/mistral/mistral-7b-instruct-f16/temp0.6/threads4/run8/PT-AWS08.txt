An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct option is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation: 
Option (A) would not be suitable as it only supports temporary storage for instance store volumes, which are not persistent. Option (C) is similar to option (A) but in this case, the EBS volume is attached to an EC2 instance and offers better performance and durability than an instance store volume. However, it does not provide long-term storage as required in this scenario. Option (D) would be suitable but it is limited to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA which provides lower durancy and availability compared to Amazon S3 Glacier. Therefore, option (B) is the most suitable choice as it offers both performance and durability for mission-critical workloads while also providing long-term storage for backup data in Amazon S3 Glacier.
