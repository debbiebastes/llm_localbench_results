Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

To determine the optimal number of EC2 instances to launch, we need to consider several factors such as the processing power, memory, and disk space of each instance, as well as the amount of data that needs to be processed.

In this case, since each instance has one KCL worker and there are six shards in total, we need to launch a minimum of six instances to ensure all shards are processed. This would result in a total of 6 EC2 instances.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 6.
