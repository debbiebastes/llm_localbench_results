A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

To comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company, it is important to encrypt both the master keys and the unencrypted data stored in the Amazon S3 bucket. This can be achieved by implementing server-side encryption with a KMS managed key (C). By doing this, all communication between the client and AWS will be encrypted using HTTPS, and the data stored in the S3 bucket will be encrypted using the KMS managed key at rest. The customer provided key cannot be used for encryption as it may not meet the regulatory requirements of the company.
