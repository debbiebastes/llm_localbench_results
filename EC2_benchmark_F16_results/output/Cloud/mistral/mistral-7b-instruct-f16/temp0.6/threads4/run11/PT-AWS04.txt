Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation: 
Since each instance has one KCL worker, we need to have the same number of KCL workers as the number of shards. Therefore, to achieve optimum performance, you should launch 6 instances which is equal to the number of open shards in your data stream.
