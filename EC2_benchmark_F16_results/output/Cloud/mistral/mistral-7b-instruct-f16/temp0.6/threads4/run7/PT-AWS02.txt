The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

The most suitable solution in this scenario would be (A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:

Option (A) is the most suitable solution as it provides a comprehensive approach to mitigate the security risk and track any configuration changes. The use of AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager allows for efficient patch management on a per-instance level, ensuring that all EC2 instances are patched and secure. Additionally, integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana enables centralized monitoring, recording, and tracking of any configuration changes made to the EC2 instances during the patching process. This approach provides a high level of visibility and control over the patching process, ensuring that all patches are deployed successfully and compliance requirements are met.

Option (B) is also suitable as it uses AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager for patch management, which is a powerful tool to automate the patching process. However, it does not provide detailed information on the configuration changes made during the patching process. Option (C) provides the same level of detail as option (A), but it uses Amazon Config instead of QuickSight with Kibana. Option (D) is a less suitable solution as it only focuses on automating the patching process, without providing any details on the configuration changes made.
