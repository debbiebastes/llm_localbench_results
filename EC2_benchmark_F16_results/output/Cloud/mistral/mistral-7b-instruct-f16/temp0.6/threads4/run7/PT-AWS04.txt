Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The maximum number of EC2 instances depends on several factors such as the CPU and memory capacity of each instance, the size of the data stream, the number of open shards, and the processing requirements. However, assuming that you launch one instance per worker, you can achieve optimum performance by launching two new instances to cover the additional shards. Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances required for your application is 7 (4 existing + 3 new).

So the correct answer is: D) 6
