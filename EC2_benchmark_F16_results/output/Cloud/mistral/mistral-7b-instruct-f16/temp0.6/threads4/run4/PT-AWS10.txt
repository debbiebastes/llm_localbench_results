An e-commerce company wants to migrate its on-premise infrastructure to Amazon Web Services. However, they are worried about ensuring their migration is secure and efficient.

Which of the following AWS Cloud Adoption Framework perspective would be the most essential for the companyâ€™s migration?

(A) Security Perspective
(B) Governance Perspective
(C) Operations Perspective
(D) Platform Perspective

Answer: 

The most essential perspective for an e-commerce company migrating to AWS would be the (A) Security Perspective. This is because ensuring security is paramount when moving sensitive customer data and financial information into the cloud. The Security Perspective provides a comprehensive framework that covers areas such as identity and access management, encryption, compliance, risk assessment, and threat mitigation. By focusing on security from the outset of the migration, the company can help protect their business and customers from potential threats.
