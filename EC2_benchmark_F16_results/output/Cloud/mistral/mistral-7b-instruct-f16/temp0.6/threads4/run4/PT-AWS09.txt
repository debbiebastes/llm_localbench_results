A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.

Explanation:
To protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes, it's important to ensure that the system can handle high levels of concurrent requests without downtime or performance issues. Here are some best practices to consider:

1. Use EC2 instances instead of Lambda functions for compute-intensive tasks, such as database queries or file processing. This will provide more control over CPU and memory resources and allow for better optimization.
2. Use ELB in front of the application to distribute requests across multiple EC2 instances, providing load balancing and high availability.
3. Enable Auto Scaling on the EC2 instances to automatically scale up or down based on demand. This will ensure that resources are always available to handle spikes in traffic and prevent downtime during peak usage periods.
4. Use CloudFront to cache static content and distribute it across multiple edge servers, reducing latency and improving performance for users located far from the origin server.
5. Consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for even better global reach and performance.

By implementing these measures, the trading platform can handle sudden spikes in traffic and ensure that its backend systems remain stable and performant even under heavy load.
