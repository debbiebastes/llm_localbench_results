A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:
Option (A) is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk as it uses AWS Config rules to detect the security groups that have allowed inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. It then associates a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function that can automatically update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address, preventing any further unauthorized access through this range. This solution provides centralized monitoring and management of security groups across all EC2 instances while also providing automated remediation to ensure compliance with company policies. 
Option (B) creates a Transit VPC which allows for routing traffic between the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances, but it does not address the unauthorized access through the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range specifically.
Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, which is a more granular approach but it still requires manual intervention to update the ACLs and may not address all instances that have allowed inbound traffic from this range.
Option (D) uses AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but it does not provide automated remediation or management of the security groups themselves.
