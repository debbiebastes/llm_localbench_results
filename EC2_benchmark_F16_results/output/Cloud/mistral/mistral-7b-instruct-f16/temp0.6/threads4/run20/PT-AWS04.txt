Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

The number of EC2 instances that you can launch depends on the number of shards in your Kinesis stream and the amount of data that needs to be processed. Each instance can handle a certain amount of processing, and you need to determine how many instances are needed for your workload.

If each instance has one KCL worker, then you will need six instances to process the six shards in the stream:

(1 KCL worker per shard) x (6 shards) = 6 instances

Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance is 6.
