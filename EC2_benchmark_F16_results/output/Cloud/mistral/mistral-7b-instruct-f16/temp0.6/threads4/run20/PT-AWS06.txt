A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend. This can happen when the function returns a response that does not match the expected format or content type. To resolve this, you should check your Lambda function's code to ensure that it returns a response that matches the expected format and content type specified in your API Gateway configuration.
