A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B) The endpoint request timed-out. When a Lambda function is called through an API Gateway, it may timeout if the underlying Lambda function takes too long to execute. This can result in a 502 Bad Gateway error being returned to the client.
In this case, the developer tried invoking the underlying Lambda function directly and found that it properly returned the result in XML format, indicating that the issue is likely related to the API Gateway proxy integration rather than the Lambda function itself. Therefore, option (B) The endpoint request timed-out is the most likely root cause of this issue.
