A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements in this scenario is:

(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

Tracking table-level events in DynamoDB using Amazon EventBridge is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements because it provides an auditing mechanism that can automatically capture all changes made to the original DynamoDB table, including insertions, updates, and deletes. By setting up a Lambda function as a rule target, you can process and save new changes to another DynamoDB table in another region, ensuring a consistent record of all changes made to the data.
Option (A) DynamoDB Accelerator is not relevant to this scenario as it only provides performance improvements for existing DynamoDB tables, and does not provide auditing capabilities.
Option (B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery is also not ideal because it only provides backup and restore capabilities for entire tables, rather than individual items or changes made to the table. It would require more manual effort to capture all changes made to the original table and save them to another table in another region.
Option (D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table is also not ideal because it requires more complex configuration and setup compared to using Amazon EventBridge, and may not provide the same level of auditing capabilities as Option (C).
