A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:
API Gateway is designed to handle traffic spikes by enabling throttling limits, which can be configured to limit the number of requests that can be made within a certain time period. This feature helps prevent the backend system from being overwhelmed with too many requests and reduces the likelihood of downtime or slow responses due to high traffic.
Additionally, API Gateway provides result caching, which allows the platform to cache the results of API calls. If a request is made for the same data multiple times, the platform can return the cached result instead of making a new call to the backend system, reducing the load on the backend and improving response time.
AWS Lambda and EC2 instances are not directly related to protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes, as they are designed for different purposes (Lambda for serverless computing, EC2 for scalable computing).
CloudFront is a content delivery network that can be used to cache static assets such as images, videos, and other files. It may help reduce the load on the platform's backend systems by caching frequently accessed resources, but it would not directly address traffic spikes caused by an influx of new users or increased interest in cryptocurrency trading.
Moving a Lambda function to a VPC is not directly related to protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes either, as VPCs are designed for network isolation and security purposes rather than load balancing or traffic management.
