A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The most operationally efficient solution to ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day is (C): Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
This option allows you to pre-provision instances in advance, so they are available and ready for use when users log in at 9 am. This can help mitigate any performance issues that may occur during the initial rush of users.
Option (A) does not take into account the specific needs of the application and could result in over-provisioning or under-provisioning of instances, leading to unnecessary costs or performance issues. Option (B) can be effective, but it may not provide a consistent enough scaling solution, as memory utilization can fluctuate throughout the day. Option (D) does not address the issue of pre-provisioning instances for the start of the day.
In conclusion, configuring a scheduled scaling policy is the most operationally efficient way to ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day.
