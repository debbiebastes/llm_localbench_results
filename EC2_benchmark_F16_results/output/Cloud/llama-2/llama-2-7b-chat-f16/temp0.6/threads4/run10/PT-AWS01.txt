A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
Explanation: 
Client-side encryption means that the data is encrypted on the client's side before it is uploaded to S3, and the encryption keys are managed by the client. In this case, the Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key to ensure that the encryption keys are securely stored and managed outside of AWS, complying with the strict compliance requirements of the company.
Option (A) is incorrect because client-side encryption with a client-side master key would not meet the compliance requirement of storing the encryption keys outside of AWS.
Option (C) is also incorrect because server-side encryption means that AWS manages the encryption keys, which may not be compliant with the company's security policies.
Option (D) is incorrect because customer provided keys are not secure and could potentially be compromised.
