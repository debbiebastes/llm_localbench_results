Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).

EventBridge is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a serverless, fully managed service that allows you to subscribe to events generated by various sources in AWS, such as Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, or Amazon API Gateway.
Other options do not provide the same level of support for event-driven applications:

(A) Amazon SQS is a message queue service that enables you to decouple components of your application architecture by allowing them to communicate through messages. However, it does not provide the same level of event-driven functionality as EventBridge.

(C) Amazon SNS is a messaging service that allows you to send messages to multiple subscribers or clients in real time. It can be used for event-driven applications, but it does not offer the same level of event processing and routing capabilities as EventBridge.

(D) Amazon Kinesis is a streaming data processing service that allows you to handle large amounts of streaming data. While it can be used for event-driven applications, it is primarily designed for real-time data processing and analysis, rather than event routing and decoupling.
