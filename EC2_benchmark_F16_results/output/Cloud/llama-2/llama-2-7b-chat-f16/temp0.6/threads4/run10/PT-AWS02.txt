The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.

Reasoning:
AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager provides a simple way to automate the deployment of patches across multiple EC2 instances. It integrates with Kibana, which allows for easy tracking and monitoring of configuration changes. This solution is ideal for immediate mitigation of security risks and audit purposes.
Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, but it does not integrate with any additional tools for tracking configuration changes. Option (C) uses AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, but it does not provide a way to automatically install patches on a weekly basis. Option (D) configures the EC2 instances to automatically install patches, but it does not provide a comprehensive solution for auditing and tracking configuration changes.
