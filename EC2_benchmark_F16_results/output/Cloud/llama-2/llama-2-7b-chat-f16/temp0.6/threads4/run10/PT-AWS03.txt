A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Reason:
Using AWS Config rules to automatically detect and remediate this security risk is the most efficient way for several reasons:
1. Scalability: AWS Config can handle large numbers of resources, making it a scalable solution for automating security management across multiple resources.
2. Ease of use: AWS Config provides an easy-to-use interface that allows you to define rules and actions based on the configuration of your AWS resources. This makes it easier to manage your security risks without having to manually review and update each resource.
3. Flexibility: AWS Config supports a wide range of AWS services, including EC2 security groups. This means you can automate security management across multiple resources using a single solution.
4. Automation: By associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule, you can automatically update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address without having to manually perform this task. This saves time and reduces the risk of human error.
5. Cost-effective: Using AWS Config rules to automate security management is a cost-effective solution because it eliminates the need for manual intervention, which can be time-consuming and expensive.
In summary, using AWS Config rules to automatically detect and remediate this security risk is the most efficient way to manage security risks in your AWS environment.
