Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched to achieve optimum performance is (D) 6.
Reasoning:
When you resharded your Kinesis stream from four shards to six shards, it means that the workload has increased by 50%. Since each instance has one KCL worker, the maximum number of instances that can be launched to achieve optimum performance is equal to the original number of instances multiplied by the resharding factor.
In this case, the original number of instances was 4, and the resharding factor is 2 (since you increased the number of shards from 4 to 6). Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched to achieve optimum performance is:
4 x 2 = 8
So, the answer is (D) 6.
