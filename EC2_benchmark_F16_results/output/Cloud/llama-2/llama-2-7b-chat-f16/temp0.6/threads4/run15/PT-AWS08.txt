An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The best solution is (C): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
Explanation:
* An EBS volume provides persistent block storage that is ideal for mission-critical workloads.
* Storing the backup data in Amazon S3 ensures durability, availability, and scalability.
* Configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA after 30 days provides an additional layer of redundancy and disaster recovery capabilities. One Zone-IA is a single Availability Zone within a region that stores data across multiple facilities for enhanced availability and durability.
* Option (A) attaches an instance store volume, which may not provide the same level of persistence as an EBS volume.
* Option (B) attaches an EBS volume but does not specify how to handle the backup data after 30 days.
* Option (D) attaches an instance store volume and uses Amazon S3 One Zone-IA, which is not a suitable solution for mission-critical workloads.
