A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements is (C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
Using Amazon EventBridge, you can set up event monitoring for specific DynamoDB tables and automatically trigger a Lambda function when certain events occur, such as a new item being added or an item being deleted. The Lambda function can then process the changes and update the other DynamoDB table in another region.
This approach provides a flexible and scalable solution that can handle the recording of new changes made to items in DynamoDB without requiring any additional infrastructure or maintenance. It also allows you to easily configure the events that trigger the Lambda function and the processing logic, making it a highly customizable solution.
