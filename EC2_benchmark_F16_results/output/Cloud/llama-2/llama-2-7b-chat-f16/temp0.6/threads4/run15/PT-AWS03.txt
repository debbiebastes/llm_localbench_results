A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to remediate this security risk would be option (A): "Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range." This approach will detect the security group rule changes without manual intervention and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Option (A) uses AWS Config to automatically monitor and manage configuration items across your AWS environment, including security groups. By associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule, you can automate the remediation process by updating the security group rules to allow traffic only from the corporate firewall IP address.
Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances, which may not be the most efficient solution as it would require additional infrastructure and configuration changes.
Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, which is a security best practice but may not be the most efficient way to remediate this specific security risk as it would require manual intervention and could potentially block legitimate traffic.
Option (D) uses AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but it may not be able to identify specific security group rules that allow traffic from this range.
