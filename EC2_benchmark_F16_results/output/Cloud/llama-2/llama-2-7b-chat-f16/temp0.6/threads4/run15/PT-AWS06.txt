A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The most likely root cause of this issue is (A): There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
When you configure a Lambda function as a backend for an Amazon API Gateway proxy, the function returns the result in the format specified in the output shape of the integration request. If the output shape is set to XML, and the function returns something else (such as JSON), it can cause the 502 Bad Gateway error.
In this case, since the developer received a 502 Bad Gateway error, it suggests that the backend function returned an unexpected response format, which caused the proxy integration to fail.
