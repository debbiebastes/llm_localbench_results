A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
The best answer is (B): Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
API Gateway can handle traffic spikes by enabling throttling limits, which allow you to set a maximum number of requests that can be made within a certain time period. This helps prevent the backend systems from being overwhelmed with too many requests. Additionally, result caching in API Gateway allows API calls to cache their results, reducing the load on the backend systems by avoiding unnecessary requests.
AWS Lambda and EC2 instances are more scalable and highly available than using AWS Lambda and API Gateway, but they require more setup and management. Using CloudFront in front of the API Gateway can provide a faster content delivery network (CDN), but it does not directly address the issue of traffic spikes. Moving the Lambda function to a VPC can also help with security and access control, but it is not directly related to handling traffic spikes.
Therefore, option (B) is the best answer.
