A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B): The endpoint request timed-out.

When a Lambda function is invoked through an AWS API Gateway proxy integration, the underlying Lambda function may take longer to execute than the maximum timeout period specified in the API Gateway configuration. As a result, the API Gateway returns a 502 Bad Gateway error to the client. To resolve this issue, you can increase the timeout period for the Lambda function or use an accelerator to speed up the execution of the underlying function.
