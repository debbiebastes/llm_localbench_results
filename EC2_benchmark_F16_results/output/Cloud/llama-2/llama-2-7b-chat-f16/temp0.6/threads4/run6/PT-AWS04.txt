Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation:
When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards is increased, which allows for parallel processing of the data stream. In this case, the original stream has four shards, and after resharding, the number of open shards increases to six.
To achieve optimum performance, you should launch a maximum of six EC2 instances to process the data stream. This is because each instance can handle up to six shards, and launching more than six instances would not provide any additional performance benefits. Therefore, option (D) 6 is the correct answer.
