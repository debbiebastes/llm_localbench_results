A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution to ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day is (C): Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
This option allows you to launch additional instances in advance of the peak usage period, ensuring that there are enough instances available to handle the increased demand at the beginning of the day. This can help mitigate any performance issues caused by a small number of instances being unable to handle the workload during the start of the day.
Option (A) is not the best solution as it relies on predictive scaling, which can be less accurate than scheduled scaling. Option (B) can also lead to unnecessary launches and terminations of instances if CPU utilization is not consistently high throughout the day. Option (D) is incorrect because CPU utilization is not always a reliable indicator of performance issues, especially during times of increased demand.
