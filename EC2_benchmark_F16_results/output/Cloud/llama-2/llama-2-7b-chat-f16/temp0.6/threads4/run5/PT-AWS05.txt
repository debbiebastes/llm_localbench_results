A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The best answer is (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:
To comply with the IT compliance requirement of recording all changes made to items in DynamoDB, you can create an EventBridge rule that triggers a Lambda function every time there is a change in the source DynamoDB table. The Lambda function can then save the new changes to a separate DynamoDB table located in another region.
Using EventBridge and Lambda provides several benefits:
1. Automation: Events are automatically detected and processed, reducing the need for manual intervention.
2. Scalability: As the volume of events increases, you can scale your Lambda function to handle the additional load.
3. Durability: EventBridge stores events in Amazon S3 for durability and retention periods, ensuring that changes are not lost.
4. Flexibility: You can configure the rule to trigger a Lambda function based on various event types (e.g., Create, Update, Delete), allowing you to handle different scenarios with custom logic.
5. Cost-effective: EventBridge and Lambda are priced based on the number of events processed, making it cost-effective compared to other solutions like DynamoDB Accelerator or Point-in-Time Recovery.
