A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

The Security Engineer should implement (B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key, to ensure that the sensitive PII data is encrypted before it is stored in the Amazon S3 bucket. Using a KMS-managed customer master key allows the company to manage its own encryption keys and keep them outside of AWS, complying with regulatory requirements.
Explanation: 

Option (A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key is not suitable for storing sensitive PII data because the master key would be stored in the client's system, which may not meet compliance requirements.
Option (C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a customer provided key is also not suitable because it requires the company to provide its own encryption keys to AWS, which may not meet compliance requirements.
Option (D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key is not a feasible option because it requires AWS to manage the encryption keys, which may not meet compliance requirements.
