A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Explanation:
Option (A) uses AWS Config rules to automatically detect any security groups that allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which is the source of the security risk. By associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule, the security group can be updated to only allow traffic from the corporate firewall IP address, remediating the security risk. This approach is efficient because it automates the remediation process without requiring manual intervention or additional tools.
Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances, but this does not directly address the security risk of allowing traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in security groups. Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, but this is a temporary solution that does not address the root cause of the issue. Option (D) uses AWS Shield to monitor and detect security threats, but it does not provide a mechanism for automatically remediating the security risk in this case.
