A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:
API Gateway provides several features that can help protect the backend systems from traffic spikes, such as throttling limits and result caching. Throttling limits can be set to limit the number of requests that a user can make within a certain time frame, preventing abuse and ensuring that the system remains stable under high traffic conditions. Result caching allows API Gateway to cache the results of a Lambda function call for a short period of time, reducing the load on the backend system during sudden increases in traffic.
Using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling (Option A) would require setting up a scalable architecture from scratch, which can be complex and time-consuming. Similarly, using CloudFront (Option C) would only provide an edge caching solution, and not address the throttling limits or result caching requirements. Moving the Lambda function to a VPC (Option D) is not relevant to this scenario.
