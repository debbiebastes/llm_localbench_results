A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (A): All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
Explanation:
If the application will be used for more than 3 years, it is the most cost-effective option to choose the All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term. This provides the lowest hourly on-demand prices and allows for flexible usage and scaling. By choosing this option, you can save upfront costs while still enjoying the benefits of reserved instances, such as predictable capacity planning and reduced costs over time.
Option (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term is not the most cost-effective choice because it does not provide the same level of savings as option (A). Option (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term is also not the best choice because it provides higher upfront costs than option (A), even though it offers more predictable capacity planning.
Option (D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year is not a viable option because it does not provide any cost savings compared to on-demand pricing, and it would require frequent upfront payments.
