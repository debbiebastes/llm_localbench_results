A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements is option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
Here's why:

* Option (A), DynamoDB Accelerator, is not relevant to this scenario as it is intended for improving read performance of DynamoDB tables.
* Option (B), DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery, is a feature that allows you to restore DynamoDB tables to a point in time in the past, but it does not provide real-time tracking of new changes made to the table.
* Option (D), DynamoDB Streams, is a feature that provides a continuous stream of change data from DynamoDB, but it requires additional setup and configuration compared to using Amazon EventBridge.
By setting up an Amazon EventBridge rule, you can automatically trigger a Lambda function whenever new changes are made to the DynamoDB table in question. This allows you to capture and save those changes in another DynamoDB table in another region, thereby ensuring compliance with IT requirements.
