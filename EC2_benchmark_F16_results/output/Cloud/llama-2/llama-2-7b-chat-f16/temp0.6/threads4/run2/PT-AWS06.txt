A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (A): There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend. This can happen when the response from the underlying function does not match the expected format, such as XML or JSON, which the API Gateway expects. The error message "502 Bad Gateway" typically indicates that there is an issue with the response from the backend service.
Therefore, option (A) is the best answer.
