An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (C): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
Explanation:
An EBS volume provides persistent block storage that can be used for mission-critical workloads. By attaching an EBS volume in your EC2 instance, you will have a reliable and high-performance storage solution for your data.
Amazon S3 is a scalable and durable object storage service that can store large amounts of data. By storing your backup data in Amazon S3, you can easily archive or transition your data to other storage services, such as Amazon S3 Glacier or Amazon S3 One Zone-IA, after 30 days.
Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a highly durable and available storage service that provides low-latency access to data across the US East region. By storing your data in Amazon S3 One Zone-IA, you can ensure that your data is protected from data center outages and network failures, while also providing low-latency access to your applications.
In summary, attaching an EBS volume in your EC2 instance and using Amazon S3 for storage provides a persistent and scalable storage solution that meets the requirements of storing mission-critical workloads, archiving data after 30 days, and ensuring low-latency access to data across the US East region.
