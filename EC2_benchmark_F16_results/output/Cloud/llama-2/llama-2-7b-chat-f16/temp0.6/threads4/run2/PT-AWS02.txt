The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (B): Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the IT Security team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk by patching the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager is a fully managed service that can automatically deploy patches to EC2 instances in a timely manner. It provides a centralized and automated way to manage patches for EC2 instances, including vulnerability scanning, patch deployment, and compliance reporting.
By using Patch Manager, the IT Security team can easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances, ensuring that the company's applications are safeguarded from various cyber security attacks. Additionally, Amazon ES (Elasticsearch Service) can be used to record and track any configuration changes made using Patch Manager, providing a centralized audit trail for compliance purposes.
Option (A) uses AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, which is not suitable for patch management. Option (C) uses AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, but does not provide a centralized audit trail for compliance purposes. Option (D) configures the EC2 instances to automatically install patches on a weekly basis, but does not address the immediate security risk or provide a fully automated patch management solution.
