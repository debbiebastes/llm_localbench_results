An e-commerce company wants to migrate its on-premise infrastructure to Amazon Web Services. However, they are worried about ensuring their migration is secure and efficient.

(A) Security Perspective
(B) Governance Perspective
(C) Operations Perspective
(D) Platform Perspective

Answer: 
The correct answer is (A) Security Perspective.

Explanation: When migrating an on-premise infrastructure to AWS, security considerations are paramount. Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data during the migration process requires careful planning and execution. The Security Perspective provides a framework for assessing, designing, and implementing secure cloud architecture. It helps identify potential security risks, develop a comprehensive security strategy, and implement appropriate controls to protect data and applications in the cloud.
By focusing on the Security Perspective during the migration process, the e-commerce company can:
1. Identify and assess potential security risks associated with migrating their on-premise infrastructure to AWS.
2. Develop a comprehensive security strategy that meets their business needs and compliance requirements.
3. Implement appropriate controls to protect data and applications in the cloud, such as encryption, access control, and identity management.
4. Ensure regulatory compliance by designing a secure architecture that meets relevant industry standards and regulations.
By prioritizing security during the migration process, the e-commerce company can minimize potential security risks, ensure data privacy and integrity, and maintain customer trust in their online platform.
