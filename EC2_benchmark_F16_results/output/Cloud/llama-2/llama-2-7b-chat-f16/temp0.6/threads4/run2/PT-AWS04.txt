Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance is (D) 6.
Explanation: When you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards, you have a total of 6 shards available for processing. Each instance can handle one shard at a time, so the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch is equal to the number of shards. In this case, since you have 6 shards, the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch is 6.
