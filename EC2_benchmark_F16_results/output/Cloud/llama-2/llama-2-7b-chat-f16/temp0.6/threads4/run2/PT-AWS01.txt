A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The Security Engineer should implement (B) - Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This option meets the requirement of storing sensitive patient data in an encrypted form, while also ensuring that the master keys are never sent to AWS. The KMS-managed customer master key can be securely generated and managed by the Security Engineer without involving AWS.
Option (A) - Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key, does not meet this requirement as the master key needs to be securely managed by the organization, which may not be possible if the keys are stored on the client side. Option (C) - Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key, is not feasible as it requires AWS to manage the master key, which goes against the compliance requirement. Option (D) - Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key, is also not feasible as it requires the Security Engineer to provide the master key to AWS, which violates the compliance requirement.
