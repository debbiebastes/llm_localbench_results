A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The most likely root cause of this issue is (B): The endpoint request timed-out.

When a Lambda function is invoked through an API Gateway proxy integration, the underlying function may take some time to execute. If the request times out before the function can complete its execution and return a response, the API Gateway will return a 502 Bad Gateway error. This is what is happening in this case.
Option (A) is incorrect because there is no indication that the output returned from the Lambda function is incompatible with the API Gateway. Option (C) is also incorrect because there is no mention of heavy loads causing occasional out-of-order invocations. Option (D) is incorrect because the API name is not invalid.
