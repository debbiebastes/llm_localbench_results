A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements is (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
EventBridge allows you to set up event-driven automation, where you can configure an event rule to trigger an AWS service or a custom Lambda function when specific events occur in your DynamoDB tables. In this scenario, you can create an EventBridge rule that triggers a Lambda function whenever new items are added, updated, or deleted from the main DynamoDB table. The Lambda function can then process these changes and save them to the other DynamoDB table in another region.
This approach has several advantages:

1. Decoupling: By using EventBridge, you decouple the application logic from the underlying DynamoDB table, making it easier to manage and maintain the application.
2. Scalability: EventBridge can handle high volumes of events without affecting the performance of your application.
3. Flexibility: You can use EventBridge with other AWS services, such as Lambda, to create complex event-driven workflows that automate various tasks in your application.
4. Cost-effective: Using EventBridge instead of DynamoDB Accelerator or Point-in-Time Recovery reduces the cost of data storage and retrieval operations.

Therefore, option (C) is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements.
