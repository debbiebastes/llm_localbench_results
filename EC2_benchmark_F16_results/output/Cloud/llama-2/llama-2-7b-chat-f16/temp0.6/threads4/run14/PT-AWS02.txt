The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is option (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Here's why:
1. AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager provides a secure, automated way to deploy OS patches to EC2 instances. It allows you to create and manage sessions that can be used to apply patches, configure systems, and automate tasks.
2. Integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana provides a visual interface for recording and tracking any configuration changes made as part of the patch management process. This will help ensure compliance audits are successful and provide visibility into the patch management process.
In contrast, options (B), (C), and (D) do not provide a comprehensive solution to this scenario:
Option (B): Setting up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy patches for EC2 instances with old operating systems is a good approach, but it does not provide integration with Amazon QuickSight or Kibana. This means that you will not have a centralized location for recording and tracking configuration changes.
Option (C): Using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy OS patches for outdated EC2 instances is a good solution, but it does not provide integration with Amazon QuickSight or Kibana. This means that you will not have a visual interface for recording and tracking configuration changes.
Option (D): Configuring the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install OS patches on a weekly basis may be a good approach, but it does not address the immediate need to mitigate the security risk posed by outdated operating systems. It also does not provide integration with Amazon QuickSight or Kibana for recording and tracking configuration changes.
In summary, option (A) provides the most comprehensive solution to this scenario, as it allows you to deploy OS patches using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, integrate with Amazon QuickSight and Kibana for compliance auditing and tracking, and address the immediate security risk posed by outdated operating systems.
