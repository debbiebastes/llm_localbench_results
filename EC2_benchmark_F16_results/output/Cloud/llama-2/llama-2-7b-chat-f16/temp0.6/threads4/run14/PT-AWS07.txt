A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution would be (C): Configuring a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation: The issue of slow performance at the beginning of the day can be attributed to the instance types and sizes used in the Auto Scaling group. During peak hours, the application requires more resources, including CPU and memory, to handle the increased workload. However, these resources are not available in the instances launched during off-peak hours.
Configuring a Scheduled scaling policy allows you to launch new instances before the start of the day, ensuring that there are enough instances available to handle the increased workload at the beginning of the day. This approach provides a consistent and predictable performance throughout the day without incurring unnecessary costs during off-peak hours.
Configuring a Predictive scaling policy (A) may not be effective in addressing the issue as it relies on historical data to forecast future usage patterns, which may not accurately reflect the changing workload patterns of the application. Dynamic scaling policies (B and D) can also lead to increased costs during off-peak hours, making them less operationally efficient.
