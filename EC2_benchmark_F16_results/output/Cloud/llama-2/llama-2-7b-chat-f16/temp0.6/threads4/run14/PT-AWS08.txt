An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
An EBS volume provides persistent block storage for EC2 instances, which meets the requirement of a mission-critical workload. Storing the backup data in Amazon S3 provides a scalable and durable storage solution, while configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier will ensure that the data is stored in a cost-effective and long-term archival storage service after 30 days.
Attaching an instance store volume (option A) may not provide the same level of durability as EBS, and may not be suitable for mission-critical workloads. Attaching an EBS volume in an EC2 instance (option C) will provide persistent block storage, but it may not be cost-effective for long-term archival storage. Using Amazon S3 One Zone-IA (option D) is not necessary for this requirement as it is designed for high-traffic web applications and may not provide the same level of durability as Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage.
