A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
B - Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:
The security engineer must implement an encryption technique that complies with the company's strict compliance and regulatory requirements. Client-side encryption ensures that sensitive data is encrypted before it leaves the application, making it more secure against unauthorized access. Using a KMS-managed customer master key provides additional protection by ensuring that only authorized parties can access and manage the encryption keys.
Option (A) is incorrect because client-side encryption does not provide the necessary level of control and security for sensitive data. Option (C) is also incorrect since it requires customers to provide their own encryption keys, which may not meet regulatory requirements. Option (D) is irrelevant as it refers to a different type of encryption technique.
