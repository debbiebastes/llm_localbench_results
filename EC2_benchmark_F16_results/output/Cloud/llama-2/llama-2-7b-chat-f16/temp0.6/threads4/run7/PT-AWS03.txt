A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to remediate this security risk would be option (A):
Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
This approach provides several benefits:

1. Automated detection: AWS Config can automatically detect whether there are any security groups that allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which means you don't have to manually check all the security groups.
2. Remediation through automation: Once the security group is detected, you can use AWS Systems Manager Automation document to automatically update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address, which ensures that the remediation is done efficiently and consistently across all the instances.
3. Scalability: This approach can be easily scaled up or down depending on the number of instances that need to be updated, which makes it a more efficient solution than other options.
4. Security: Using AWS Config and Systems Manager Automation documents ensures that the remediation is done securely and in compliance with your organization's security policies.
In contrast, option (B) would require manual configuration of the Transit VPC and routing tables, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Option (C) would block all traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which may not be appropriate if there are legitimate reasons for allowing some traffic from this range. Option (D) would monitor security groups for traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range but wouldn't automatically remediate the issue.
