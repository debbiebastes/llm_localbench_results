A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day is (C): Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
Explanation:

During peak hours, when users are logging in, the workload on the application increases, causing slower performance. By scheduling new instances to be launched before the start of the day, you can ensure that there are enough instances available to handle the increased workload, resulting in faster response times for users during the start of the day.
Configuring a Predictive scaling policy (A) would not help since it relies on historical data to predict future usage patterns, which may not accurately reflect the actual workload during peak hours.
Configuring a Dynamic scaling policy based on CPU utilization (D) may also not be effective since CPU utilization may not necessarily correlate with application performance.
Configuring a Dynamic scaling policy based on Memory utilization (B) can also be less effective since memory usage may fluctuate throughout the day due to various factors, such as caching and data retrieval, making it difficult to determine when to launch new instances.
Therefore, scheduling new instances before the start of the day using a Scheduled scaling policy (C) is the most operationally efficient solution to ensure optimal performance during peak hours.
