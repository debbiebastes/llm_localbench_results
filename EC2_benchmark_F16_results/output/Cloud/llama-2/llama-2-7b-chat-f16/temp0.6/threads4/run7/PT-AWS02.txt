The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Rationale:
AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager provides a flexible, scalable, and secure way to manage and automate tasks across multiple EC2 instances. By integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, the IT Security team can easily monitor and analyze the patch status of all affected EC2 instances, as well as track any configuration changes made to those instances. This provides a comprehensive view of the security posture of the company's applications, which is essential for audit purposes.
Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, but it does not provide the same level of flexibility and integration with other AWS services as Sessions Manager. Option (C) uses AWS Config to record and track configuration changes, but it may not be as effective in managing patches across multiple EC2 instances. Option (D) automates the patch installation on a weekly basis, but it does not provide real-time monitoring and tracking of patch status.
