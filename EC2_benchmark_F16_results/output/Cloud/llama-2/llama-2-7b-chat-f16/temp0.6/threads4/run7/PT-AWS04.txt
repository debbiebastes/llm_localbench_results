Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation:
When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards is increased. In this case, you have six open shards after resharding, which means that each instance can process one-third of the data volume. To achieve optimum performance, you should launch six EC2 instances to utilize the full capacity of your Kinesis stream. This will allow each instance to process one-sixth of the total data volume, resulting in maximum throughput and efficiency.
Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 6.
