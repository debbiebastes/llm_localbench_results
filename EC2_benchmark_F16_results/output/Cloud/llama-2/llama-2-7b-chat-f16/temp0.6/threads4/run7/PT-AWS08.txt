An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
To meet the organization's requirement, you should choose (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.
Here's why:
* An EBS volume provides persistent block storage that is ideal for mission-critical workloads.
* Storing backup data in Amazon S3 allows you to store large amounts of data and scale as needed. You can also configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which is an cost-effective archiving solution.
* Using Amazon S3 for both the primary and backup storage ensures that your data is stored in the same location, which simplifies management and reduces complexity.
* By storing the backup data in Amazon S3, you can easily retrieve it when needed, without having to worry about data loss or corruption.
While (A) using instance store volumes may provide faster performance, it is not recommended for mission-critical workloads as they are ephemeral and can be lost upon instance termination.
Similarly, while (C) storing backup data in Amazon S3 One Zone-IA provides lower latency, it may not be cost-effective for large amounts of data, and (D) using an instance store volume in a different Availability Zone does not provide the same level of redundancy and durability as EBS volumes.
