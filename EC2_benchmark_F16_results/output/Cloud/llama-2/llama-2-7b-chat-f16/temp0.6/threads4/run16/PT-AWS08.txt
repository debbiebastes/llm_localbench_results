An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.

Explanation:
An EBS volume provides block level storage that can be attached to multiple EC2 instances, making it a good choice for mission-critical workloads. Since the backup data will be stored for 30 days before being transferred to a data archiving service, an EBS volume is suitable for storing the backup data.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not persistent and are only available within the instance they are attached to. Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a storage class that is optimized for frequent access to objects in a single Availability Zone, which may not be suitable for storing backup data for 30 days.
Option (D) is incorrect because it involves attaching an instance store volume, which is not a persistent storage option.
