A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and then associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
This option is the most efficient because it leverages AWS Config, which allows you to manage and monitor resources across multiple accounts, regions, and environments. By using AWS Config, you can automate the detection and remediation of security risks like this one in a consistent and scalable manner.
Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances, which may not be necessary in this scenario, as the company already has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all traffic should pass through.
Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, but it does not address the root cause of the security risk. It also may block legitimate traffic to the EC2 instances, causing downtime and disruptions.
Option (D) uses AWS Shield to monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but it does not provide a mechanism for automatically remediating the security risk. It also may generate unnecessary alerts and costs for monitoring traffic that is already being monitored by the corporate firewall.
