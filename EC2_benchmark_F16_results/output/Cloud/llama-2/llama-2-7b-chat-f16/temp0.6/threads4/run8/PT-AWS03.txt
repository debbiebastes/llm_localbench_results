A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:
This option is the most efficient because it leverages AWS Config, which is designed specifically for managing and automating AWS resources. By using AWS Config, you can easily detect and remediate security risks like this without having to manually review each security group. Additionally, by associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule, you can automatically update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address, ensuring that all traffic is routed through the correct network.
Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances, but this approach may not be practical or feasible in all cases. It requires additional infrastructure and configuration, which can add complexity and cost to the solution.
Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, but this approach may not be effective in detecting and remediating security risks like this. Network ACLs are designed to control access to individual network interfaces or subnets, rather than automatically updating security groups based on specific criteria.
Option (D) uses AWS Shield to monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but this approach may not be practical or feasible in all cases. AWS Shield is primarily designed for DDoS protection, rather than security group management. Additionally, it may not provide granular control over specific IP ranges like the one mentioned in the scenario.
