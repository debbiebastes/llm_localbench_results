A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The most likely root cause of this issue is (A): There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
When a Lambda function is used as a backend for a proxy integration, it needs to return a valid HTTP response with a status code that indicates the request's outcome. If the Lambda function returns an invalid or incomplete response, the Amazon API Gateway may not be able to process it and may return a 502 Bad Gateway error to the client.
In this case, since the developer tried invoking the underlying function but received the result in XML format, it is likely that the Lambda function returned an invalid or incomplete response, causing the 502 Bad Gateway error.
