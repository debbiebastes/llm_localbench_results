The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, the IT Security team can easily deploy the patches to the affected EC2 instances without requiring manual intervention. This solution provides a centralized and automated way to manage the patching process, ensuring that all instances are up-to-date with the latest security fixes.
Integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana allows for easy tracking and recording of any changes made to the patch and compliance statuses, which is essential for audit purposes. This solution provides a complete view of the patching process, making it easier to monitor and manage the entire lifecycle of the patches.
Compared to other options, (B) Setting up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager does not provide automated deployment of patches, and (C) Using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager requires manual intervention, which can lead to delays in deploying patches. Also, (D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis may not be practical or feasible for all instances, especially those that are critical or have specific requirements.
