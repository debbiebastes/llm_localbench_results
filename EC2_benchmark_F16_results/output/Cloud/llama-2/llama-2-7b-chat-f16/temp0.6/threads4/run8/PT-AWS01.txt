A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
B
The Security Engineer should implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key to meet the requirement of never sending the master keys or unencrypted data to AWS. With this approach, the master key is managed by the customer and only decrypted data is sent to AWS for storage in Amazon S3. This ensures that sensitive PII remains encrypted throughout its lifecycle, even during transmission to AWS for storage.
