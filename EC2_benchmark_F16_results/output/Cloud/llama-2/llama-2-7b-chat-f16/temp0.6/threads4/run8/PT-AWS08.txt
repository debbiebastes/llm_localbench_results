An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (C): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
Explanation:
An EBS volume provides persistent block storage that is ideal for mission-critical workloads. Since the backup data will be stored in an object storage service after 30 days, it's recommended to use an EBS volume instead of an instance store volume.
Amazon S3 provides a scalable and durable storage solution that can be used for both cold and warm archiving. By using Amazon S3 One Zone-IA, you can store your backup data in a single Availability Zone, which can help reduce latency and improve performance.
Lifecycle policies can be used to automatically transition objects between storage classes based on certain criteria, such as the age of the object. In this case, you can configure a lifecycle policy to move the backup data from Amazon S3 Standard to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA after 30 days. This will help reduce costs and improve performance by storing cold data in a more cost-effective storage class.
