A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (C): Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
Explanation:
The issue at hand is that the application starts slow during the beginning of the day, and then improves after a couple of hours. This can be due to various reasons such as insufficient instance capacity, high CPU or Memory utilization, etc. To address this issue, the most operational efficient solution would be to launch new instances before the start of the day using a Scheduled scaling policy.
Configuring a Scheduled scaling policy allows you to specify a schedule for when new instances should be launched, and can help ensure that there are enough instances available during peak usage hours. By launching new instances before the start of the day, you can ensure that there is sufficient capacity to handle the expected load at the beginning of the day, which will improve performance and reduce slowness.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy, while it can help adjust the number of instances based on historical data, may not be the best solution in this case as it relies on predicting future usage patterns, which may not always be accurate.
Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on Memory utilization, while it can help adjust the number of instances based on current usage patterns, may not be the most efficient solution as it doesn't take into account the expected load at the beginning of the day.
Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on CPU utilization, is not the best option in this case as it will adjust the number of instances based on CPU usage, which may not necessarily address the issue of slow performance during the start of the day.
Therefore, the most operationally efficient solution would be to configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
