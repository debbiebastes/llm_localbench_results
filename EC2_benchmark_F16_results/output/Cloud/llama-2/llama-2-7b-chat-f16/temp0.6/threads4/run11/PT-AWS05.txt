A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 

The most ideal way to comply with the requirements is option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
Here's why:

EventBridge is a serverless event bus service offered by AWS that allows you to collect, transform, and act on events from various sources, including DynamoDB. By creating an EventBridge rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, you can automatically capture new changes made to items in the main table and save them to another DynamoDB table in another region.
Option (A), DynamoDB Accelerator, is not relevant to this scenario as it's designed to accelerate read operations on a specific DynamoDB table, which may not be necessary for this use case. Option (B) is also not ideal as it enables Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) to automatically sync the two tables, but it does not provide real-time data capture and processing capabilities like EventBridge does.
Option (D) is also not ideal as DynamoDB Streams are designed to stream events from a DynamoDB table in real time, but they do not provide a convenient way to capture changes made to specific items in the table. Instead, you would need to enable streaming for the entire table, which may result in unnecessary data transfer and processing costs.
In summary, using EventBridge with a Lambda function as a rule target is the most efficient and cost-effective way to comply with the IT compliance requirements while also providing real-time data capture and processing capabilities.
