Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched to achieve optimum performance is (D) 6. This is because, as stated in the question, you have already launched four KCL workers per instance on average, and launching six shards will result in a total of 24 KCL workers. With this configuration, the maximum throughput of data that can be processed by the system is achieved, which is the optimum performance level.
