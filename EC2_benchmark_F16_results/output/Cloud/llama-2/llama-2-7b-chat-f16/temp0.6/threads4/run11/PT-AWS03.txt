A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Explanation:
This option is the most efficient because it leverages AWS Config, which is a service that allows you to track changes to your AWS resources and enforce configuration standards across your environment. By using AWS Config rules, you can automatically detect security groups that allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range and remediate them by updating the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is efficient because it automates the remediation process without requiring manual intervention.
Option (B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because it requires setting up an additional VPC, which can add complexity to your environment.
Option (C) Blocking the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL is not a scalable solution because it would require manually updating the Network ACL every time a new instance is launched with an inbound rule.
Option (D) Using AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is not relevant to this problem because AWS Shield is focused on DDoS protection rather than security group configuration.
