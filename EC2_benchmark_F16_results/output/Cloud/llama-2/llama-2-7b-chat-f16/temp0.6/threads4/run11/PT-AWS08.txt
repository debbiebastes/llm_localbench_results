An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.

Explanation:

You need a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, and you want to store the backup data in object storage. An Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume provides block-level storage volumes that are attached to an EC2 instance. You can use S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which meets the requirement of storing backup data in object storage.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not recommended for mission-critical workloads as they are ephemeral and do not provide persistent storage.
Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a storage service that provides low-latency access to data in a single Availability Zone, but it does not provide the necessary persistence for mission-critical workloads.
Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not supported in EC2 instances.
