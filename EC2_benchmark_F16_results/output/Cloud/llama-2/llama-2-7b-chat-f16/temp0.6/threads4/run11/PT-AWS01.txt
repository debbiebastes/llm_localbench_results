A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The Security Engineer should implement option (B): Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.
Explanation:
By using a KMS-managed customer master key, the hospital can retain control over the encryption process while maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements. This approach ensures that the sensitive PII data is encrypted at rest and in transit using a client-side encryption technique, which eliminates the need to store the unencrypted data or the master keys on AWS.
Option (A) is not viable as it would require storing the client-side master key on AWS, which violates the hospital's compliance requirements. Option (C) is also not feasible since it requires the customer to manage their own encryption keys, which can be challenging and increase the risk of non-compliance.
Option (D) is incorrect because the customer must use a KMS-managed key for client-side encryption, not a customer-provided key.
