Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched to achieve optimum performance is (D) 6.
Explanation:
When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards is increased, which allows more instances to process the data in parallel. In this case, the original stream had four shards, and each instance had one KCL worker, for a total of 4 x 1 = 4 EC2 instances. To achieve optimum performance, we resharded the stream to increase the number of open shards to six, which allows for 6 x 1 = 6 EC2 instances to process the data in parallel. Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched to achieve optimum performance is 6.
