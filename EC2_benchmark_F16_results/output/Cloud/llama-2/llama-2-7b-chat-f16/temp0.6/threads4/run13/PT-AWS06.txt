A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B): The endpoint request timed-out.

When a Lambda function is invoked through an API Gateway proxy integration, the invocation is asynchronous and can take some time to complete. If the request times out before the function completes, it can return a 502 Bad Gateway error, which is what the developer observed in this case. To troubleshoot this issue, the developer can check the AWS CloudWatch logs for any error messages related to timeouts or other issues with the Lambda function invocation.
