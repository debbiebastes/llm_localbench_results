An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.

Explanation:
An EBS volume provides persistent block storage that can be attached to multiple EC2 instances, making it a good choice for mission-critical workloads. Amazon S3 provides a cost-effective and durable object storage service that can store backup data for long-term retention. By attaching an EBS volume in your EC2 instance, you can ensure that the persistent block storage is available for your mission-critical workloads, while using Amazon S3 to store your backup data for long-term retention.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not persistent and do not provide the same level of durability as EBS volumes. Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a storage service that provides low latency and high throughput for active workloads, but it does not provide the same level of durability as Amazon S3.
Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not available in all regions, so you may not be able to attach one in every region where your EC2 instance is running.
