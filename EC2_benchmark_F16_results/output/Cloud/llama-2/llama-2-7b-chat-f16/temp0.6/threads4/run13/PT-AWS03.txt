A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The most efficient way to remediate this security risk is option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. This approach involves the following steps:
1. Configure an AWS Config rule to monitor for security groups with inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.
2. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule. This automation document will contain the steps required to remediate the security risk, such as updating the security group to allow traffic only from the corporate firewall IP address.
3. When the Config rule detects a security group allowing traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, the Lambda function will be triggered to execute the remediation steps.
This approach is the most efficient because it automates the detection and remediation process, ensuring that all security groups are updated consistently across the AWS environment. Option (B) involves setting up a Transit VPC, which may require additional infrastructure and configuration, while option (C) blocks traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACLs, which can be less efficient and may cause performance issues. Option (D) uses AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but it does not provide a comprehensive solution for remediating the security risk.
