A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The most operationally efficient solution to implement is (C): Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day. This approach would allow you to proactively launch additional instances before the high usage period, ensuring that the application has enough resources to handle the increased demand at the beginning of the day.
Option (C) provides a more predictable and controlled scaling behavior compared to options (A), (B), or (D). Option (A) could result in over-scaling during off-peak hours, while option (B) could lead to slow scaling responses during critical periods. Option (D) could result in under-scaling during the early hours of the day if the CPU utilization is not accurately predicted.
By scheduling new instances before the start of the day, you can ensure that the application has enough resources to handle the increased demand at the beginning of the day, reducing the likelihood of slow performance and user complaints.
