Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).

EventBridge is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It allows you to route events from multiple sources to multiple targets, such as Lambda functions, Amazon SNS topics, Amazon Kinesis streams, and more. With EventBridge, you can set up real-time event routing and automate tasks based on events generated by your applications or external sources.
Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS), Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), and Amazon Kinesis are also AWS services that can help you build event-driven applications, but they have different use cases and features than EventBridge.
