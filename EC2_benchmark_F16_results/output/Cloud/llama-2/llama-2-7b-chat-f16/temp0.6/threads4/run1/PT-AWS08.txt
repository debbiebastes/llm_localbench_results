An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (A): Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
Instance store volumes are designed for use with Amazon EC2 instances and provide faster performance compared to other storage options like EBS volumes. They also provide persistence, which is essential for mission-critical workloads.
By attaching an instance store volume to your existing EC2 instance, you can ensure that your backup data is stored persistently and can be quickly accessed when needed. You can then use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days.
Amazon S3 Glacier provides long-term archiving storage at a lower cost compared to other Amazon S3 storage classes. By storing your backup data in Amazon S3 Glacier, you can reduce storage costs and ensure that your data is preserved for an extended period.
Therefore, option (A) is the best answer.
