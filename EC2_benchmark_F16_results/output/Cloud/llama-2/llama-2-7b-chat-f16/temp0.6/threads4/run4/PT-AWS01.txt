A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.
Explanation:
The Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption using a KMS-managed customer master key to ensure that the sensitive PII is encrypted before it is stored in the Amazon S3 bucket. This approach provides several benefits, including:
* The master keys and unencrypted data are never sent to AWS, which meets the compliance and regulatory requirements of the company.
* Only authorized users can access the encrypted data using their own encryption keys, providing an additional layer of security.
* Amazon S3 handles the encryption and decryption of the data, ensuring that the encryption is secure and reliable.
While option (A) also provides client-side encryption, it requires the Security Engineer to manage the master key themselves, which may be challenging in a highly regulated environment. Option (C) does not provide adequate security as it allows customers to use their own encryption keys, which may not meet compliance requirements. Option (D) is not secure as customer-provided encryption keys may not be managed or monitored by AWS.
