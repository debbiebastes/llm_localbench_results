A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B): The endpoint request timed-out.
When a Lambda function is invoked through an API gateway, the request may time out if it takes longer than the configured timeout period to complete. This can cause a 502 Bad Gateway error to be returned to the client. In this case, the developer receiving a 502 error suggests that the Lambda function did not complete within the expected time frame, causing the API gateway to return an error.
Option (A) is incorrect because there is no indication in the given information that the output from the Lambda function is incompatible with the API gateway.
Option (C) is also unlikely, as there is no mention of heavy loads causing occasional out-of-order invocations.
Option (D) is incorrect because the API name being invalid would not cause a 502 Bad Gateway error to be returned by the API gateway.
