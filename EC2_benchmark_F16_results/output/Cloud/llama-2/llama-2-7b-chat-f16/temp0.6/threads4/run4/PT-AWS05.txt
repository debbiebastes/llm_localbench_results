A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements would be option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, and set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
This approach has several advantages:

1. **Event-driven architecture**: By using EventBridge, you can decouple your application logic from the underlying data storage (DynamoDB). This makes it easier to manage and scale your application, as well as enables you to take advantage of serverless computing principles.
2. **Real-time processing**: With EventBridge, you can set up real-time monitoring of DynamoDB tables. As soon as changes are made to the table, an event is triggered, which can then be processed by your Lambda function. This ensures that the new changes are saved in the other table immediately.
3. **Low latency**: By using CloudWatch Events (formerly known as EventBridge), you can reduce latency compared to using DynamoDB Accelerator or Point-in-Time Recovery. This is because CloudWatch Events processes events near the source of data, rather than having to send them over the network to a separate service.
4. **Cost-effective**: By leveraging the serverless architecture, you don't have to worry about provisioning or managing servers, which can reduce costs compared to using DynamoDB Accelerator or Point-in-Time Recovery.
5. **Easy to set up**: Setting up an EventBridge rule and configuring a Lambda function as a target is relatively straightforward, especially if you're already familiar with AWS services.

Therefore, option (C) is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements of recording all new changes made to DynamoDB items in another DynamoDB table in another region.
