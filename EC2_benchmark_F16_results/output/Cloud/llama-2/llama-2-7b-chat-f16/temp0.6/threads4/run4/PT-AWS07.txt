A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
Explanation:
The most operationally efficient solution to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day is to configure a scheduled scaling policy that launches new instances before office hours. This would ensure that there are enough instances available during peak usage hours, reducing the likelihood of slow performance due to high workload.
Option (C) provides this functionality by allowing you to schedule the creation of new instances at a specific time, in this case, before office hours. Option (A) does not provide this functionality as it only adjusts the number of instances based on historical data, and may not launch new instances before peak usage hours. Options (B) and (D) do not address the issue of ensuring enough instances are available at the beginning of the day.
