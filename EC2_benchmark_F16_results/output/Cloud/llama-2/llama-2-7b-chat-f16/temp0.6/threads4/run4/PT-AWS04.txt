Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The correct answer is (D) 6.

Explanation: When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards is increased, which means that more instances are needed to process the stream. In this case, since you have six open shards after resharding, you will need at least six EC2 instances to process the stream optimally.
Option (A) 5 is incorrect because five instances may not be enough to handle the increased load caused by resharding. Option (B) 12 is also incorrect because scaling up to twelve instances would not provide any significant performance improvement, and would only increase costs. Option (C) 3 is incorrect because three instances are not enough to process the stream optimally after resharding.
