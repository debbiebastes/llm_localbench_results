An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (A): Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
Instance store volumes are optimized for performance, but they do not provide the persistence required for mission-critical workloads. EBS volumes, on the other hand, provide block level storage that is persistently stored and can be used for mission-critical workloads.
By attaching an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance, you will have a persistent block storage volume that can be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data can then be stored in Amazon S3, which provides a scalable and durable storage solution. To ensure that the data is stored in a cost-effective manner, you can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days.
Option (B) is incorrect because EBS volumes do not provide the same level of performance as instance store volumes. Option (C) is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA does not provide the same level of durability and availability as Amazon S3 Glacier. Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not supported in EC2 instances that use one zone only.
