The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (B): Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
AWS Systems Manager (SSM) provides a comprehensive solution for managing patches, configurations, and compliance across AWS resources. Patch Manager in SSM allows you to easily deploy patches to EC2 instances with old operating systems, ensuring that the security risk is mitigated promptly. Additionally, Amazon ES (Elasticsearch Service) can be used to record and track any configuration changes made as part of the patch management process.
Option (A) uses AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, which is a different service from Patch Manager, and may not provide the same level of control and visibility over patch deployments. Option (C) uses AWS Config, which is a configuration management service that can be used to record and track changes, but may not provide the same level of patch management capabilities as Patch Manager. Option (D) does not provide a comprehensive solution for managing patches and configurations across EC2 instances with old operating systems.
Therefore, the best solution is to use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy OS patches for outdated EC2 instances, along with Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
