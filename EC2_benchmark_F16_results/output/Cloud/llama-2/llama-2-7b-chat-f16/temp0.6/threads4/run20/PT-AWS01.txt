A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The Security Engineer should implement (B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.
Explanation:
AWS provides two types of encryption in Amazon S3: client-side encryption and server-side encryption. Client-side encryption means that the data is encrypted on the client's device before being uploaded to S3, while server-side encryption means that the data is encrypted by AWS before being stored in S3.
For this scenario, the Security Engineer should use client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach ensures that the sensitive PII data remains encrypted both in transit and at rest, as the master keys are never sent to AWS. The Security Engineer can use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage the customer master keys securely, complying with the company's strict compliance and regulatory requirements.
Option (A) is incorrect because client-side encryption with a client-side master key does not provide the same level of security as KMS-managed customer master keys. Option (C) is also incorrect because server-side encryption with a customer provided key is not secure, as the master keys are still stored on AWS servers and could be compromised in case of an attack.
Therefore, the Security Engineer should choose option (B) to implement Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key for storing sensitive PII data.
