The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (B): Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager simplifies the process of applying OS patches to your EC2 instances, making it easier to ensure that your instances are up-to-date and secure. It also provides a detailed audit trail of all patch management activities, which is essential for compliance reasons. Additionally, Amazon ES (Elasticsearch Service) can be used to store and search log data from various sources, including AWS Systems Manager, providing a centralized location to record and track any configuration changes.
Option (A) does not provide the same level of automation and auditing capabilities as Option (B). While Option (C) also provides some automation, it does not offer the same level of integration with other AWS services as Option (B). Option (D) is not a practical solution as it requires manual intervention to install patches on a weekly basis.
