Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation: When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards is increased to six. Since each instance has one KCL worker, the maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched to achieve optimum performance is equal to the number of open shards plus one (for the KCL worker). Therefore, the answer is option (D) 6.
Option (A) 5 is incorrect because there is no point in launching more than six EC2 instances if the number of open shards is already five.
Option (B) 12 is incorrect because resharding a Kinesis data stream does not change the number of instances that can be used for processing.
Option (C) 3 is incorrect because there is no point in launching three EC2 instances if the number of open shards is six or more.
