A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

The answer is (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation:

As the users are complaining about slow performance during the start of the day, it means that there might be an increased demand for resources at the beginning of the day. To address this issue, a Scheduled scaling policy can be configured to launch new instances before the start of the day. This will ensure that there are enough instances available to handle the increased demand at the beginning of the day, and the application performance will be better.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy is not the best option as it relies on machine learning algorithms to predict the future resource usage, which might not always be accurate. Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on Memory utilization might lead to over-provisioning of resources, resulting in unnecessary cost and wastage. Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on CPU utilization might also lead to over-provisioning of resources, as the CPU usage is not always a good indicator of resource demand.
Therefore, option (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day is the most operationally efficient solution to ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day.
