An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The best option is (C): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.

Explanation:
As per the given requirement, you need to use persistent block storage for mission-critical workloads. EBS is the preferred choice for this use case as it provides high throughput and IOPS for critical workloads.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads. They have a lower performance compared to EBS and are also ephemeral, which means they will be deleted when the instance is terminated.
Option (B) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 does not provide persistence for objects stored in it. While you can configure lifecycle policies to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, this will not provide the required level of persistence for mission-critical workloads.
Option (D) is incorrect because one zone EBS volumes are not suitable for archiving purposes. They are designed to provide high availability and low latency within a single Availability Zone, but they do not provide the necessary durability and storage capacity for long-term archiving.
Therefore, option (C) is the best choice as it provides the required level of persistence, performance, and scalability for mission-critical workloads while also providing a cost-effective solution for archiving purposes.
