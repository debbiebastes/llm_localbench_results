A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
B - Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:
The Security Engineer must implement client-side encryption in AWS S3 to ensure that sensitive patient data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Of the available options, only option B meets the requirement of not sending the master keys or unencrypted data to AWS, as it uses a KMS-managed customer master key.
Option A (client-side master key) would involve storing the master key on the client side, which is not compliant with the security requirements. Option C (server-side encryption with a customer provided key) would also involve sending the master key to AWS, which violates the security policy. Option D (server-side encryption with a KMS managed key) can be used for encrypting data at rest but does not provide client-side encryption and thus may still expose the data in transit.
