A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B): The endpoint request timed-out.

When a Lambda function is invoked through an AWS API Gateway, the function has a limited time window to complete its execution before the API Gateway times out and returns a 502 Bad Gateway error. This timeout value is set by default to 30 seconds, but it can be adjusted in the API Gateway settings.
In this scenario, it's possible that the Lambda function is taking longer than expected to execute, causing the API Gateway to timeout and return a 502 error. The developer can check the Lambda function logs to see if there are any errors or slowdowns that could be causing the issue.
Option (A) is incorrect because an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend would cause a different error message, such as a 400 Bad Request.
Option (C) is also unlikely, as occasional out-of-order invocations due to heavy loads should not result in a 502 Bad Gateway error.
Option (D) is incorrect because the API name being invalid would cause a different error message, such as a 400 Bad Request or a 404 Not Found error.
