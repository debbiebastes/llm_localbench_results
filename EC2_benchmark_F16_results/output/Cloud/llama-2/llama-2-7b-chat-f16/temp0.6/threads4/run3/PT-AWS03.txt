A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
This approach provides several benefits:

1. Efficient detection: Using AWS Config rules allows for real-time monitoring of security groups, enabling quick identification of any unauthorized traffic sources.
2. Automated remediation: By associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule, any security groups found to be allowing traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range can be automatically updated with the corporate firewall IP address.
3. Scalability: AWS Config rules can handle a large number of security groups and EC2 instances, making it a scalable solution for this use case.
4. Integration with Systems Manager: Using Systems Manager Automation documents allows for easy integration with existing SSM processes, streamlining remediation efforts.
While options (B) and (C) may also be effective solutions, they have some limitations:

(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances: While this approach can help route traffic through the corporate firewall, it may not be feasible or efficient for large-scale environments with numerous EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL: This approach can block legitimate traffic as well, leading to performance issues and potential downtime. Additionally, it may not be feasible to update the Network ACL for all security groups in a timely manner.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range: While AWS Shield can provide real-time monitoring and detection of security threats, it may not be feasible or efficient for a large number of security groups, particularly in dynamic environments with frequent changes.
In conclusion, option (A) is the most efficient way to automatically remedi
