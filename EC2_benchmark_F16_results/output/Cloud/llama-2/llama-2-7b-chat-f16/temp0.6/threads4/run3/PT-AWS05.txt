A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 

The MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements is option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:
This scenario requires real-time monitoring and recording of changes made to items in DynamoDB in another region. Option (C) provides the best solution by using Amazon EventBridge, which can track events from any AWS service, including DynamoDB, and trigger a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
Option (A) DynamoDB Accelerator is not relevant to this scenario.
Option (B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery does not provide real-time recording of changes, which is a requirement in this scenario.
Option (D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table can also be used to achieve this goal, but it may require additional configuration and setup compared to option (C).
