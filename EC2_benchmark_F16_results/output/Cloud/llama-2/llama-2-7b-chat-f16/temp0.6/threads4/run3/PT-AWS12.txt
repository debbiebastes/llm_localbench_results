A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

The answer is (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation: When using Reserved EC2 instances, the cost savings come from paying upfront for the instance and receiving a discounted rate for the duration of the reservation. The longer the reservation term, the greater the cost savings. In this case, the company is looking to save on costs over a period of more than 3 years, making option (C) the most cost-effective choice.
Option (A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term would provide the least cost savings and would not be the best choice for a long-term application. Option (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term would also not be the most cost-effective option as there is no upfront payment, resulting in less discounts on the reservation fee.
Option (D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year may seem attractive as it would provide flexibility to cancel the reservation after one year, but it would also result in higher costs overall compared to option (C).
