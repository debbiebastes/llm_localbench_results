Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The correct answer is (D) 6.

Explanation:
When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards in each instance is directly related to the maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched for optimal performance. In this case, you have six open shards per instance, which means that you can launch a maximum of 6 / 1 = 6 EC2 instances to achieve optimum performance. Therefore, the answer is (D) 6.
Note: The other options are not correct because they do not take into account the resharding of the stream and the number of open shards per instance.
