A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (C): Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation:
The issue at hand is that the application performance is slow during the start of the day, and it takes some time to become normal after a couple of hours. To address this, the most operationally efficient solution would be to configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day. This will ensure that there are enough instances available during the peak hour to handle the increased traffic and provide better performance.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy is not the best solution as it relies on historical data to predict future usage, which may not always be accurate. Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on Memory utilization may also not be effective as the performance issue may not be solely due to memory usage. Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on CPU utilization is also not the best solution as it may lead to overprovisioning of instances, which can result in wasted resources.
In summary, scheduling new instances before the start of the day using a Scheduled scaling policy is the most operationally efficient solution to ensure the application works properly during peak hours.
