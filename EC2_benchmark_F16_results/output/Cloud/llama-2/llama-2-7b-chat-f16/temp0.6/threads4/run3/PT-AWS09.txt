A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:
API Gateway can handle traffic spikes by enabling throttling limits and result caching. Throttling limits can be set to restrict the number of requests that a user can make within a certain time frame, thereby preventing overload on the backend systems. Result caching allows API Gateway to cache responses to frequently asked questions, reducing the load on the backend systems and improving response times.
Using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling is not necessary in this scenario as AWS Lambda is already designed to handle traffic spikes and auto-scale based on demand. Using CloudFront in front of the API Gateway can also improve performance by caching responses, but it is not necessary for protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes. Moving the Lambda function to a VPC is also not relevant to this scenario as it does not address the issue of traffic spikes.
Therefore, option (B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway is the correct answer.
