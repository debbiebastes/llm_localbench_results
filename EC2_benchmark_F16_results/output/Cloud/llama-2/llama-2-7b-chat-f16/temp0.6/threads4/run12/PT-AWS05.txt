A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements would be option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, and set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach provides several benefits:

1. **Monitoring and logging**: Using EventBridge allows you to log all table-level events in DynamoDB, providing a comprehensive audit trail of all changes made to the data.
2. **Real-time processing**: By setting up a Lambda function as a rule target, you can process new changes to the other table in real-time, ensuring that the data is up-to-date across both tables.
3. **Automation**: With EventBridge and Lambda, you can automate the process of capturing and saving new changes to the other table, eliminating the need for manual intervention.
4. **Scalability**: As your application grows, you can easily scale your EventBridge and Lambda functions to handle increased data volume and processing requirements.
5. **Cost-effective**: Using EventBridge and Lambda instead of DynamoDB Accelerator or Point-in-Time Recovery can help reduce costs by only charging for the resources used, rather than a fixed fee for accelerating all writes.

In summary, option (C) is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements as it provides real-time processing, automation, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.
