An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.
Explanation:
To meet the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, you should use an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume in your EC2 instance. EBS provides block-level data storage that is highly available and durable, making it suitable for mission-critical applications.
To store backup data in an object storage service after 30 days, you can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier, which provides low-cost archival storage. You can also use Amazon S3 One Zone-IA, which is designed for infrequently accessed data and provides a lower cost than standard S3 storage.
Attaching an EBS volume in your EC2 instance is the best option to meet the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads.
