A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

API Gateway can handle traffic spikes by enabling throttling limits, which allow you to set maximum request rates for each endpoint. This can help prevent the backend systems from being overwhelmed with requests. Additionally, API Gateway provides result caching, which allows you to cache the results of API calls so that repeated requests for the same data do not hit the backend system.
Using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling (option A) would require significant infrastructure changes and can be more complex to set up and manage. Using CloudFront in front of the API Gateway (option C) can also help with caching, but it may not be able to handle as much traffic as API Gateway's built-in caching. Moving the Lambda function to a VPC (option D) is not directly related to handling traffic spikes and would likely require additional networking configuration changes.
Therefore, option B is the best answer.
