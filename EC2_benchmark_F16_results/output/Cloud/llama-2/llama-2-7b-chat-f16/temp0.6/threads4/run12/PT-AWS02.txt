The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.

Rationale:

Option (A) provides a comprehensive solution that addresses both the immediate need to mitigate the security risk and the audit requirement for recording changes. AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager allows for efficient patch management, while integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana provides an effective way to monitor and track configuration changes.
Option (B) is a good choice for monitoring configuration changes but does not provide a straightforward solution for deploying patches.
Option (C) requires setting up AWS Config, which may add additional complexity to the solution.
Option (D) involves configuring automatic patch installations on a weekly basis, which may not be enough to address the immediate security risk and may also introduce additional complexity in managing patches.
