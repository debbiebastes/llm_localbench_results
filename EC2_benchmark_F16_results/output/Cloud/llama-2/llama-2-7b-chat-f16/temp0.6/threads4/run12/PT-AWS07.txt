A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution would be:

(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation:
The issue at hand is that the application is slow during the start of the day, and this can be addressed by launching new instances before the start of the day using a Scheduled scaling policy. This will ensure that there are enough instances available to handle the load when users start using the application.
Option (A) Predictive scaling policy: While predictive scaling policies can be useful in forecasting future usage patterns, they may not take into account any unexpected spikes in traffic during peak hours. As a result, it may not always provide the optimal number of instances to handle the load.
Option (B) Dynamic scaling policy: Launching new instances based on memory utilization can be effective in addressing performance issues, but it may not solve the problem of slow performance at the start of the day. As users start using the application, there may still be a delay before new instances are launched and become available to handle the load.
Option (D) Dynamic scaling policy based on CPU utilization: Similarly to option (B), launching new instances based on CPU utilization may not address the issue of slow performance at the start of the day.
In summary, using a Scheduled scaling policy to launch new instances before the start of the day is the most operationally efficient solution as it ensures that there are enough instances available to handle the load when users start using the application.
