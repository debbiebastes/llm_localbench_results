Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation: When resharding your Kinesis data stream from four shards to six shards, it is important to ensure that you have sufficient EC2 instances available to handle the increased load. The maximum number of EC2 instances required will depend on factors such as the volume of data being processed, the complexity of the processing operations, and the availability of other resources in your system.
In this case, since you resharded your stream from four shards to six shards, it means that the load on each instance has been increased by 50%. To achieve optimum performance, you would need at least six EC2 instances to handle the increased load. Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances required is six.
Option (D) is the correct answer.
