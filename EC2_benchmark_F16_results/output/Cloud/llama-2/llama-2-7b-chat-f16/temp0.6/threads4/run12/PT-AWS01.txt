A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The security engineer should implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.
Explanation:
Amazon S3 provides two types of encryption for data stored in buckets: server-side encryption and client-side encryption. Client-side encryption is recommended as it allows the hospital to manage their own encryption keys, which are never sent to AWS.
Option (A) is incorrect because client-side master keys must be managed by the customer, not by AWS. Option (B) is also incorrect because KMS-managed customer master keys are not recommended for sensitive data like PII as they are exposed to AWS. Option (D) is incorrect because customer provided keys are not supported in S3.
Therefore, the Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key to ensure that the hospital maintains control over their encryption keys and complies with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company.
