A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

The most cost-effective option would be (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
Explanation:

If the application being hosted will be used for more than 3 years, it is more cost-effective to choose a Reserved Instance with an upfront payment. This is because the hourly rate for a Standard Reserved Instance decreases over time as the instance is in use, and the upfront payment can be spread out over multiple years to reduce the overall cost.
Option (A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term would not provide the same long-term savings as option (C), as the hourly rate for a Convertible Reserved Instance increases over time, making it more expensive in the long run. Option (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term is also not the most cost-effective option, as it does not provide any upfront discount and the hourly rate for a Convertible Reserved Instance increases over time. Option (D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year would also not be the most cost-effective option, as there is no upfront payment and the instance must be renewed annually, which can result in higher overall costs.
