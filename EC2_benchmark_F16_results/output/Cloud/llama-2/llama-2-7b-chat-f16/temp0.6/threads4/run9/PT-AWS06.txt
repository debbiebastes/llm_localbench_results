A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B): The endpoint request timed-out.

When a Lambda function is invoked through an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration, the underlying function may take some time to execute. If the request times out before the Lambda function completes execution, the client will receive a 502 Bad Gateway error. This can happen if there are heavy loads on the underlying function or if there are issues with network latency.
Option (A) is incorrect because an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend would cause a different error code (400 Bad Request). Option (C) is also incorrect because occasional out-of-order invocations due to heavy loads would not necessarily cause a 502 Bad Gateway error. Finally, option (D) is incorrect because the API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is not related to the 502 Bad Gateway error.
