A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
The best approach to protecting the backend systems of a cryptocurrency trading platform from traffic spikes would be (B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
API Gateway provides features such as throttling limits, which can help control the rate of incoming requests and prevent the backend system from being overwhelmed. Additionally, result caching can help reduce the load on the backend system by storing frequently requested data in memory, reducing the need to retrieve it from the database each time.
Option (A) is not the best choice as it would require a more significant architectural change to switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling. This would likely result in higher costs and greater complexity.
Option (C) is not the best choice as CloudFront can only cache at the edge of the network, closer to the user, rather than caching results in the API Gateway itself. This means that it may not provide the same level of performance improvement as option (B).
Option (D) is not the best choice as moving a Lambda function to a VPC would not provide any direct benefits for protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes.
