A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (C): Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
Explanation: The slow performance during the start of the day can be attributed to the instance types and sizes being used, which may not have enough resources to handle the traffic at that time. By configuring a Scheduled scaling policy to launch new instances before the start of the day, you can ensure that the application has sufficient resources to handle the traffic immediately after the start of the day, reducing the slow performance issue.
Option (A) is incorrect because Predictive scaling policies use historical data to predict future resource usage and adjust instance counts accordingly. However, in this case, the slow performance during the start of the day is not a consistent pattern, making it challenging for the predictive policy to accurately forecast resource usage.
Option (B) is incorrect because Dynamic scaling policies launch new instances based on real-time CPU or Memory utilization. If the instance types and sizes are not optimized for the workload, launching additional instances based on CPU or Memory utilization may not address the slow performance issue during the start of the day.
Option (D) is incorrect because Dynamic scaling policies use real-time CPU or Memory utilization to adjust instance counts, but in this case, the slow performance during the start of the day is not caused by high CPU or Memory usage.
