An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.
Explanation:
To meet the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, you should use an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume in your EC2 instance. EBS volumes are designed to provide high-performance, durable storage for running applications and can be attached to multiple instances.
Storing the backup data in Amazon S3 is a good choice because it provides a highly scalable and durable storage service that can handle large amounts of data. However, since you want to store the data for 30 days before transitioning it to a lower-cost storage service, you should use an EBS volume instead of an instance store volume, as EBS volumes are more persistent than instance store volumes.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not designed to provide high-performance, durable storage for running applications. They are intended for use in development and testing environments where temporary access to high CPU and memory resources is required.
Option (C) is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a lower-cost storage service that is optimized for infrequently accessed data. It is not suitable for storing data for 30 days, as it may take longer to retrieve the data when needed.
Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not designed to provide high-performance, durable storage for running applications. They are intended for use in development and testing environments where temporary access to high CPU and memory resources is required.
