A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
B - Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:
The Security Engineer should implement Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. This will ensure that the sensitive PII data is encrypted before it leaves the hospital's premises, and only authorized personnel can access the decrypted data in AWS.
Option (A) is incorrect because client-side encryption with a client-side master key does not provide adequate security as the master key is stored on the client machine, which may be vulnerable to unauthorized access or breaches.
Option (C) is also incorrect as server-side encryption with a customer-provided key does not provide enough control and management of keys for compliance purposes.
Option (D) is irrelevant as KMS-managed keys are managed by AWS, not the customer.
