Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events). EventBridge is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture by allowing you to attach event sources, such as Amazon S3 buckets or Lambda functions, to events in your application. From there, you can trigger actions based on these events across multiple services, including Amazon SNS, Amazon Kinesis, and more.
