A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to remediate this security risk is (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
This solution is the most efficient because it uses AWS Config, which is designed specifically for automating configuration management tasks, such as updating security groups. By using AWS Config, you can easily track changes to your infrastructure and automatically apply remediation actions when necessary. Additionally, by associating an Automation document with a Lambda function in the AWS Config rule, you can execute custom logic to update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Option (B) setting up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances is not the most efficient solution as it requires additional infrastructure and complexity, including adding a new VPC, configuring transit gateways, and updating security groups.
Option (C) blocking source IP addresses coming from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACLs is not a scalable or sustainable solution as it requires manually updating the ACLs each time there is a new source IP address that needs to be blocked.
Option (D) using AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups that allow traffic directly from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range does not provide the same level of automation as option (A) and requires additional infrastructure and setup.
