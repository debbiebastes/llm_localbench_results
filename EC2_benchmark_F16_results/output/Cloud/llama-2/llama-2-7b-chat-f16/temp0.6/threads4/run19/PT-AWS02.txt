The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The most suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes. This approach provides several benefits:
1. Automated deployment of patches: Using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, the IT Security team can automate the process of deploying OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances, ensuring that all instances are updated in a timely manner.
2. Centralized management: AWS Systems Manager provides a centralized platform for managing and monitoring the EC2 instances, including tracking changes to configurations. Integrating with Amazon QuickSight and Kibana enables real-time monitoring of compliance statuses.
3. Compliance recording: By integrating with Amazon QuickSight and Kibana, the IT Security team can record and track any configuration changes, providing audit evidence for regulatory compliance.
In comparison, options (B), (C), and (D) have limitations:
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy patches for EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes: While this approach provides automated deployment of patches, it does not offer centralized management or real-time monitoring of compliance statuses.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes: This approach provides centralized management through AWS Config, but it does not offer automated deployment of patches or real-time monitoring of compliance statuses.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install OS patches on a weekly basis: While this approach can ensure regular patching, it may not provide immediate mitigation of security risks in case of a vulnerability discovery. Additionally, tracking changes to configurations may be challenging without centralized management.
In conclusion, the most suitable solution for mitigating the security risk and recording compliance statuses is (A): Deploy OS patches for outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, integrate with Amazon QuickSight and Kibana to record changes, and provide centralized management and real-time monitoring.
