A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:
API Gateway is designed to handle high traffic and scalability, and it provides several features that can help protect the backend systems from traffic spikes. One of these features is throttling limits, which allow you to set quotas on the number of requests that can be made within a certain time period. This can help prevent the platform from becoming overwhelmed with too many requests and slowing down the system.
Another feature of API Gateway is result caching, which allows you to cache the results of API calls so that they don't have to be re-executed every time a request is made. This can help reduce the load on the backend systems and improve the overall performance of the platform.
Option (B) is the best answer because it provides the necessary features to protect the backend systems from traffic spikes. Option (A) would require switching to a more scalable architecture, which may not be necessary in this scenario. Option (C) is not relevant as CloudFront is a content delivery network and does not provide the same level of protection as API Gateway. Option (D) is incorrect because moving the Lambda function to a VPC would not help protect the backend systems from traffic spikes.
