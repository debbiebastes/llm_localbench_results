An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
An EBS volume provides persistent block storage, which is ideal for mission-critical workloads that require a reliable storage solution. By attaching an EBS volume in your EC2 instance, you can ensure that your data is persistently stored and available even if the instance terminates or fails.
Storing backup data in Amazon S3 provides a scalable, durable, and secure storage solution. You can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which will help you save on storage costs by archiving older data. Amazon S3 Glacier is a long-term archival storage service that provides a low-cost, on-demand storage solution for infrequently accessed data.
Therefore, option (B) is the best answer. Options (A), (C), and (D) do not meet the requirement of providing a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads and storing backup data in Amazon S3 with a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days.
