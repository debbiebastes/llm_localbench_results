A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

The most cost-effective option for a company migrating an On-Demand EC2 instance to a Reserved EC2 instance for more than 3 years would be (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:

Reserved Instances offer significant cost savings compared to On-Demand instances, especially when you commit to using them for a longer period of time. The most cost-effective option for a company planning to use an EC2 instance for more than 3 years would be to choose the Standard Reserved Instance pricing with an upfront payment.
Standard Reserved Instances have a fixed hourly fee that is lower than On-Demand prices and includes a one-time upfront payment. By making a 3-year commitment, you can save up to 64% compared to the same instance running on an On-Demand basis over the same period of time.
Option (A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term is not the most cost-effective option as it does not provide the same level of savings as Standard Reserved Instances. Option (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term is also not the best choice as you would be paying the highest hourly rate possible without any upfront discount.
Option (D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year is also not a cost-effective option as it does not provide the same level of savings as Standard Reserved Instances and would require you to renew the instance every year.
Therefore, the most cost-effective option for a company migrating an On-Demand EC2 instance to a Reserved EC2 instance for more than 3 years would be (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
