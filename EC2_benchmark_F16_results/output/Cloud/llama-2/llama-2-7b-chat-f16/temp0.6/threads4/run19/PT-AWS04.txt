Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation:
When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards is increased. In your case, you have an existing stream with four shards per instance and each instance has one KCL worker. By scaling up to six open shards, you will be able to process more data in parallel.
To achieve optimum performance, you should launch a maximum of 6 EC2 instances, which is the number of open shards available in your stream. Launching more than 6 instances will not lead to better performance as each instance will have to handle only half the load of processing the data stream. Therefore, option (D) 6 is the correct answer.
