A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

API Gateway can handle traffic spikes by enabling throttling limits, which allow you to control the number of requests that can be made to your backend APIs within a certain time period. This can help prevent the backend systems from becoming overwhelmed and slowing down or crashing due to an influx of incoming requests.
API Gateway also provides result caching, which allows you to cache the results of API calls so that repeat requests for the same data do not need to go through the backend APIs. This can help reduce the load on the backend systems and improve the performance of the overall system.
