The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (B): Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
Here's why:
AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager is a fully managed service that automatically detects and applies security patches, bug fixes, and other updates to your EC2 instances. It can also be configured to automate the patching process on a schedule, such as weekly or monthly, to ensure that your instances are always up-to-date with the latest security patches.
By using Patch Manager, you can easily deploy OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances without having to manually install them. This will help you quickly and efficiently mitigate the security risk associated with the discovered vulnerability.
In addition, Amazon ES (Elasticsearch Service) can be used to record and track any configuration changes made as part of the patching process. This will provide a detailed audit trail of all changes made to your instances, which is important for compliance and regulatory purposes.
Option (A) is not the best choice because it involves deploying the OS patches using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, which may not be as efficient or scalable as Patch Manager in this scenario. Option (C) is also not the best choice because while it uses AWS Config to record and track configuration changes, it does not provide the same level of automation and efficiency as Patch Manager.
Option (D) is not a feasible solution because it requires manually configuring the patching process on a weekly basis, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. It also may not ensure that all instances are up-to-date with the latest security patches in a timely manner.
