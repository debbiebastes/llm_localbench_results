A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The answer is (C): Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day. This solution will ensure that additional instances are launched before the start of the workday, which should help mitigate any performance issues during the early morning hours. By scheduling the scaling in advance, you can ensure that there are enough instances available to handle the increased load at the beginning of the day without having to rely on predictive or dynamic scaling, which may not be as effective in this scenario.
