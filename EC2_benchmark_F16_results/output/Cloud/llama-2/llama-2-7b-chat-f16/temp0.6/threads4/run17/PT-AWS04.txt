Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation: When you resharded your Kinesis data stream to increase the number of open shards, each instance now has two KCL workers, resulting in a total of six EC2 instances. Launching additional instances will not improve performance as there are already enough worker instances to handle the increased shard count. Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch is six.
