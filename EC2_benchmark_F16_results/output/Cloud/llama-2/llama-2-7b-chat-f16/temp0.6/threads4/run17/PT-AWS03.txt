A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Explanation:
Option (A) is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk because it leverages AWS Config, which can automatically detect changes to resources in an AWS account, including security groups that allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. By associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule, you can automate the remediation process by updating the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is more efficient than manual remediation, as it eliminates the need for human intervention and reduces the time required to fix the issue.
Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances, but this solution does not address the immediate security risk of allowing traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range directly to the EC2 instances.
Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, but this solution does not address the root cause of the security risk and may introduce additional complexity in managing network traffic.
Option (D) uses AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but this solution is not specific to the security group rule changes and may not be able to detect and remediate the issue in real-time.
