A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The most cost-effective option would be (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
Explanation:
When using Reserved Instances, Amazon Web Services offers two pricing options: Convertible Reserved Instances and Standard Reserved Instances. The main difference between these two is that Convertible Reserved Instances allow you to convert your reserved instances to On-Demand instances if needed, while Standard Reserved Instances do not offer this flexibility.
For long-term commitments like 3 years, it is more cost-effective to use Standard Reserved Instances instead of Convertible Reserved Instances. This is because the price for Standard Reserved Instances decreases over time as you commit to a longer term. In contrast, Convertible Reserved Instances have a fixed upfront price and do not offer any long-term discounts.
Option (A), All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term, is more expensive than using Standard Reserved Instances for a 3-year term. Option (B), No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term, does not provide any long-term discounts and would also be more expensive than using Standard Reserved Instances.
Therefore, the most cost-effective option is to use Standard Reserved Instances for a 3-year term, which offers the best balance of price and flexibility for long-term commitments.
