Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).
AWS Service: Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as AWS CloudWatch Events) is an event bus that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It allows you to collect and process events from multiple sources, such as AWS services, on-premises systems, and custom applications, and then route those events to multiple targets, such as Lambda functions, Amazon SNS topics, or Amazon Kinesis streams. EventBridge provides a centralized way to manage and orchestrate the flow of events across your application architecture, allowing you to build more scalable, resilient, and agile applications.
