The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is option (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Here's why:
* AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager allows you to automate the deployment of patches for the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. This is a quick and efficient way to mitigate the security risk without manual intervention.
* Integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana provides an auditable record of all patch deployments and associated compliance statuses, which meets regulatory requirements for auditing and reporting.
While options (B) and (C) also address the problem, they are less suitable than option (A) for several reasons:
* Option (B) requires setting up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, which may add additional complexity to the solution.
* Option (C) involves using AWS Config, which is a different service from AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. This may require additional configuration and setup.
* Option (D) does not provide an automated way to deploy patches on a regular basis, which could lead to delays in mitigating the security risk.
