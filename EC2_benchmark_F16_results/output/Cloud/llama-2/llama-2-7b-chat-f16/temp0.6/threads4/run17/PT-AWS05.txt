A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements is option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
EventBridge allows you to monitor and react to changes in your AWS resources, including DynamoDB tables. You can configure an EventBridge rule to trigger a Lambda function whenever there are changes made to a specific DynamoDB table. The Lambda function can then process the new changes and save them to another DynamoDB table in another region.
Option (A) DynamoDB Accelerator is not relevant to this scenario as it only provides low-latency data access for applications that require real-time data access, and does not address the requirement of recording and storing new changes made to DynamoDB items.
Option (B) Enabling Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) is also not relevant to this scenario as it only provides a backup mechanism for point-in-time restore of DynamoDB tables, and does not address the requirement of recording and storing new changes made to DynamoDB items.
Option (D) Enabling DynamoDB Streams and configuring a Lambda function is also not the best approach as it requires additional infrastructure and configuration to set up the stream and process the events, whereas option (C) leverages EventBridge which is already available in AWS and can be easily configured to meet the requirements.
