An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.
Explanation:
To meet the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, you should use an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume in your existing EC2 instance. An EBS volume provides block-level storage that is highly available and durable, making it ideal for storing mission-critical data.
Storing backup data in Amazon S3 is a good idea because it provides a scalable, durable, and secure object storage service. However, you should use an EBS volume instead of an instance store volume (which is stored on the instance's hard drive) to ensure that your data is persisted even if the instance crashes or is terminated.
Option (A) is not the best choice because instance store volumes are not designed for persistent storage and may be lost during instance termination or reboot. Option (C) is also not a good choice because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a suitable option for mission-critical workloads, as it has limited availability and high latency compared to other Amazon S3 storage classes.
Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are stored on the instance's hard drive, which may be lost during instance termination or reboot, making them unsuitable for persistent storage.
