Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 

The correct answer is (B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).

Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed event bus that allows you to subscribe to events from multiple sources, such as AWS services and custom applications, and route them to one or more targets, such as AWS Lambda functions or other microservices.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a messaging queue service that enables you to decouple components of your application architecture by queuing messages for processing. However, it does not provide the same level of event-driven programming as EventBridge.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a messaging service that allows you to send notifications or messages to multiple subscribers or clients. While it can be used for event-driven programming, it is not as fully featured as EventBridge in this regard.

Amazon Kinesis is a stream processing service that enables you to build real-time data pipelines and process large amounts of streaming data. While it can be used for event-driven programming, it is not designed specifically for this purpose.
