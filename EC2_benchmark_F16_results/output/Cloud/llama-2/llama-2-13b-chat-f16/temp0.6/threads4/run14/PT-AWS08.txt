An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B. Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Rationale: An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume is a persistent block-level storage volume that will be suitable for mission-critical workloads. Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides a highly durable and scalable store for data. By attaching an EBS volume to an EC2 instance and storing backup data in Amazon S3, you can ensure that your data is both persistent and secure. Additionally, configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days will provide long-term storage at a lower cost.

Note: Option A is incorrect because an instance store volume is not persistent and would not be suitable for mission-critical workloads. Option C is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not designed for long-term storage and would not be appropriate for backup data. Option D is incorrect because there is no need to attach an instance store volume to the EC2 instance.
