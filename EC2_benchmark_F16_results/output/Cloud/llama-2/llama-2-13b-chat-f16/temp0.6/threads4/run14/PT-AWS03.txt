A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is option (A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. This approach allows for the automatic detection and remediation of security groups that are not following the company's security policies, without the need for manual intervention.

Option (B) Setting up a Transit VPC would require additional infrastructure setup and maintenance, and would not address the immediate security risk posed by the unapproved security groups.

Option (C) Blocking the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL would also require additional configuration and might block legitimate traffic as well.

Option (D) Using AWS Shield to monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range would not provide a solution for automatically remediating the security risk, but rather for monitoring and detecting it.
