A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation:
A 502 Bad Gateway error occurs when the upstream server (in this case, the Lambda function) returns an invalid or incompatible response. Since the developer was able to invoke the underlying function and it properly returned the result in XML format, it suggests that the issue is with the output returned from the Lambda function. Therefore, option (A) is the most likely root cause of the 502 Bad Gateway error.
