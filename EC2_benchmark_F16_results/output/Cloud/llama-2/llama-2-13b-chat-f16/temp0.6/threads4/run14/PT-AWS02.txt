The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation: 
Option C is the most suitable solution in this scenario as it provides a centralized way to manage patching across multiple EC2 instances, and automatically deploys the patches to the instances with outdated operating systems. Additionally, using AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes will help ensure compliance and auditing purposes.

Option A is not suitable as Systems Manager Sessions Manager is used for executing commands on remote instances, but it doesn't provide a centralized way to manage patching. Option B is also not suitable as Amazon ES is not intended for recording and tracking configuration changes. Option D is not feasible as it does not address the immediate security risk, and would not provide an audit trail of the changes made to the instances.
