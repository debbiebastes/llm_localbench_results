A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:

The best approach to ensure that sensitive PII data is encrypted in compliance with strict regulations and not sent to AWS is to implement client-side encryption. The client-side encryption approach ensures that the data remains encrypted even when it's stored in AWS, as only the client-side has access to the encryption keys.

KMS (Key Management Service) managed customer master key is a secure way to manage the encryption keys for S3 client-side encryption. The KMS managed master key will be stored outside of AWS and never sent to AWS. This approach ensures that the sensitive PII data remains encrypted at all times, even when it's stored in AWS.

Option A is not a secure approach as it uses a customer-managed key, which can be compromised if the customer's infrastructure is breached.

Option C is not a secure approach as it uses a KMS managed key that is stored in AWS.

Option D is not a secure approach as it uses a customer provided key, which may not be secure enough to protect sensitive PII data.
