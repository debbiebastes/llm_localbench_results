The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

The most suitable solution in this scenario is option C: Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Rationale:

Option A is not a viable solution as it only provides a solution for deploying patches but does not provide a way to record and track configuration changes.

Option B is also not a suitable solution as it only provides a solution for recording and tracking configuration changes, but does not provide a way to easily deploy patches.

Option D is not a good choice as automating the installation of OS patches on a weekly basis may not be feasible or practical in this scenario, especially if the instances are in use.

Option C provides the most comprehensive solution by using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the OS patches and AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes, thereby ensuring both the security of the instances and compliance with audit requirements.
