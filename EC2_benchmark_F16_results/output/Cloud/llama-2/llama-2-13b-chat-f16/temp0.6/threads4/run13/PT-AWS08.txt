An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
B - Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Option A is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads and cannot be used for long-term storage.

Option C is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a storage class that provides infrequent access to data, but it is not designed for long-term archiving.

Option D is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads and cannot be used for long-term storage.

Therefore, the best option is B - Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier. This will provide a persistent block storage volume for your mission-critical workloads and allow you to use Amazon S3 for long-term storage of your backups. Additionally, by configuring a lifecycle policy, you can automate the process of moving your backup data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which will help reduce storage costs.
