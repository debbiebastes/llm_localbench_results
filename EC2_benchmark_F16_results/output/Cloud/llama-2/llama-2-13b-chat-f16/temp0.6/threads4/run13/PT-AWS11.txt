Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Amazon EventBridge is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed event bus that allows you to communicate between different microservices or applications in real time, without having to write any glue code or manage any infrastructure.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queuing service that allows you to decouple components of your application by sending messages between them, but it does not provide the same level of event-driven architecture as EventBridge.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a push notification service that allows you to send notifications to multiple subscribers or clients, but it is not designed for decoupling components of your application.

Amazon Kinesis is a streaming data service that allows you to build real-time data pipelines and process large amounts of data in motion, but it is not primarily focused on event-driven architecture.
