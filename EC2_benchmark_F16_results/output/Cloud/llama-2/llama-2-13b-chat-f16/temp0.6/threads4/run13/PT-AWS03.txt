A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:

This is the most efficient way to automatically remediate the security risk because it leverages AWS Config, which provides a centralized way to manage resources, to detect and correct the security groups that allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. The Systems Manager Automation document can be used to update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address, effectively blocking unauthorized traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. This approach is more efficient than manually updating each security group, which would require a lot of manual effort and time. Additionally, using AWS Config rules to detect and remediate security risks can help ensure compliance with security policies and best practices.

The other options are not the most efficient way to remediate the security risk:

B) Setting up a Transit VPC would require additional infrastructure setup and would not directly address the issue of unauthorized traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

C) Blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL would only block traffic from the specified range and would not update the security groups with the corporate firewall IP address.

D) Using AWS Shield to monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range would require additional setup and would not provide a centralized way to remediate the issue.
