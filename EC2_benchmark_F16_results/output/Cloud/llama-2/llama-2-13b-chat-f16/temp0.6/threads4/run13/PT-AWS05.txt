A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C

Explanation:
Option C is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements because it allows for real-time tracking of changes made to the items in DynamoDB, without the need for manual intervention or additional infrastructure like Accelerator or Point-in-Time Recovery. EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) provides a centralized event bus that allows you to subscribe to events from multiple sources, including DynamoDB. By creating a rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, you can automatically process and save new changes to the other table using a Lambda function as a rule target. This approach is scalable, secure, and eliminates the need for manual intervention, making it the most ideal solution.

Note: Option D, Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table, is also a valid option but requires more setup and maintenance compared to Option C.
