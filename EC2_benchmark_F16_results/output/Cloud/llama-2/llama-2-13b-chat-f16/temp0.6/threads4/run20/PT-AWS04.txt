Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

B

Explanation:
When resharding, the number of open shards increases, and KCL worker instances can now read from more shards simultaneously. This improves throughput but does not change the processing capacity per instance. Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances required to achieve optimum performance remains unchanged at six (6).

Hence, option B is the correct answer.
