A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.

Explanation:

Option (A) is not the best choice because it would require significant changes to the existing architecture and may not provide immediate relief from traffic spikes. Option (B) is also not ideal because it would limit the number of requests that can be processed, which could lead to a suboptimal user experience.

Option (C) using CloudFront in front of the API Gateway is the best choice because it can act as a cache and help absorb traffic spikes. CloudFront can cache frequently accessed content, such as static assets and APIs, and serve them from edge locations closer to users. This can help reduce the load on the backend systems and improve the performance of the platform. Additionally, CloudFront provides a scalable and highly available infrastructure for serving cached content, which can help protect the backend systems from traffic spikes.

Option (D) moving the Lambda function in a VPC is not relevant to protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes. However, it may be necessary to ensure better security and isolation of the Lambda function.
