A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:

The cost-effective option would be to choose (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option provides the lowest total cost of ownership over the 3-year period, despite the upfront payment being higher compared to other options.

Here's why:

1. Convertible Reserved Instances offer more flexibility than Standard Reserved Instances. With Convertible Reserved Instances, you can change the instance type or the operating system at any time without incurring additional fees. This can be beneficial if your application requirements change over time.
2. The No Upfront option for Convertible Reserved Instances allows you to pay less upfront and spread the costs over 3 years, which can help with cash flow management.
3. The total cost of ownership for a 3-year term is lower with the No Upfront option compared to other options, despite the higher upfront payment. This is because you'll be paying less each month, and you'll avoid paying additional fees for instance type changes or operating system updates.
4. By choosing a 3-year term, you're committing to using the Reserved Instance for a longer period, which can help you take advantage of lower prices and save more on costs over time.

Therefore, the best option for the company would be to choose (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term to save on cost and benefit from the flexibility of converting instance types or operating systems without additional fees.
