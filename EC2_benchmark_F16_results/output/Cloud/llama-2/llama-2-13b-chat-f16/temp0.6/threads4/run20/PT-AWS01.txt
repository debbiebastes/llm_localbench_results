A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation: 
To comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company, it is essential to ensure that the sensitive PII data is encrypted at all times, even when it's being stored in AWS. Of the options provided, the best approach would be to implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

This approach ensures that the master keys are never sent to AWS and remain secure on the client side. The client-side encryption also ensures that the data is encrypted before it's sent to AWS, providing an additional layer of security. With this approach, only authorized clients can access the encrypted data, further reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

Therefore, option B is the best answer.
