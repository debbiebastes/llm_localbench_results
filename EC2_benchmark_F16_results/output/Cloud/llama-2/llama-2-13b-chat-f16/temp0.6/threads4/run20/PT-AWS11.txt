Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed event bus that allows you to subscribe to events generated by other AWS services, such as AWS Lambda functions, AWS API Gateway, and more.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queue service that enables you to decouple components of your application architecture, but it does not provide event-driven functionality. Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a messaging service that sends messages or push notifications to multiple subscribers or clients, but it does not provide event-driven functionality either. Amazon Kinesis is a streaming data firehose service that enables you to collect and process large amounts of streaming data, but it does not provide event-driven functionality in the same way as EventBridge.
