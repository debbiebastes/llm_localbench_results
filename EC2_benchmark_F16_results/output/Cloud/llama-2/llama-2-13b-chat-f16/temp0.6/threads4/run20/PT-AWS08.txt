An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation: 

A persistent block storage volume is required for mission-critical workloads, which can be provided by an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume. Option B is the correct choice as it provides an EBS volume and uses Amazon S3 to store backup data, which meets the requirement of using a persistent block storage volume and storing backup data in an object storage service.

Option A does not provide a persistent block storage volume and instead attaches an instance store volume, which is not suitable for mission-critical workloads. Option C transitions objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA instead of Glacier, which may not be the desired storage class for backup data. Option D also does not provide a persistent block storage volume and instead attaches an instance store volume, which is not suitable for mission-critical workloads.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B.
