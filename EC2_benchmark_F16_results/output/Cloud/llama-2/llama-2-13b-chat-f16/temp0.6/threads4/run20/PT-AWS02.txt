The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the most suitable solution is option C, which uses AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances, and sets up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes for audit purposes. This approach provides a centralized and automated way to manage patching across multiple instances and records all changes for compliance reporting.

Option A does not provide a comprehensive solution for patch management and does not integrate with Kibana, which is required for compliance reporting. Option B uses ES to record changes, but does not provide an easy way to deploy patches. Option D does not provide a centralized way to manage patching and may not be feasible for large number of instances.
