A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation: 
To comply with the company's strict compliance and regulatory requirements, the Security Engineer should implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach ensures that the master keys are not stored or transmitted to AWS, as they are managed by the customer's KMS. The data will be encrypted on the client side using the KMS-generated key, and only the encrypted data will be sent to AWS. This way, both the master keys and the unencrypted data remain within the control of the company at all times, meeting the compliance requirements.

Option (A) is incorrect because it uses a client-side master key, which may not be secure enough for sensitive PII data. Option (C) is also incorrect because it uses a KMS-managed server-side key, which would require storing the master keys in AWS. Option (D) is incorrect because it allows the customer to provide their own encryption key, which may not meet the compliance requirements of the company.
