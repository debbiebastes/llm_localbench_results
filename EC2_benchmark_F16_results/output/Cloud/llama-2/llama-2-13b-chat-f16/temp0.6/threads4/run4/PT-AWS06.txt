A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 

The MOST likely root cause of this issue is option A, "There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend."

When a Lambda function is used as a backend for an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration, the output of the Lambda function must be compatible with the content type specified in the API Gateway. If the output is not compatible, it can cause a 502 Bad Gateway error.

Therefore, the developer should check the output of the Lambda function to ensure that it is compatible with the content type specified in the API Gateway. The fact that the developer was able to invoke the underlying function and receive a proper result in XML format suggests that the Lambda function is working properly, so the issue is likely related to the output compatibility.
