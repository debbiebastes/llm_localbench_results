Answer: 

The correct answer is (D) Platform Perspective.

The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework provides a structured approach to migrating an organization’s on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. The Platform Perspective focuses on evaluating and selecting the appropriate AWS services and tools to support the company’s migration.

This perspective considers factors such as workload assessment, application porting, and platform configuration. By using the Platform Perspective, the e-commerce company can ensure that their migration is efficient and secure, and that their applications are optimized for the AWS cloud.
