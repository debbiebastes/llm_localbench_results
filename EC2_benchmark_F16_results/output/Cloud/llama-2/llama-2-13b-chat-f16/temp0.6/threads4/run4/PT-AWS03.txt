A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:

Option A is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk because it uses AWS Config rules to detect the security groups that allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and then associates a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is efficient because it automates the process of detecting and remediating the security risk, reducing the need for manual intervention and minimizing the potential for human error.

Option B (Setting up a Transit VPC) would also be effective in remediating the security risk, but it may not be as efficient as Option A because it would require additional infrastructure setup and configuration.

Option C (Blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL) would also be effective in remediating the security risk, but it may not be as efficient as Option A because it would require additional configuration and maintenance of network access control lists.

Option D (Using AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range) would be effective in detecting the security risk, but it may not be as efficient as Option A in remediating the risk because it does not provide a direct way to update the security group configuration.
