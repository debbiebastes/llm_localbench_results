An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
B: Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation: 
EBS (Elliptical Block Store) is the recommended choice for block-level storage in EC2 because it provides persistent storage that remains even if the instance is terminated or stopped. It also offers more capacity and better performance than instance store volumes. Attaching an EBS volume to your EC2 instance will provide the required persistent block storage for mission-critical workloads.
Amazon S3 is a highly durable object storage service that provides easy accessibility, high availability, and scalability. Storing backups in Amazon S3 and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days will meet the backup and archiving requirements of the organization.
Option A is incorrect because instance store volumes are not persistent and will be lost if the instance is terminated or stopped. Option C is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is an infrequently accessed storage class that is not designed for mission-critical workloads. Option D is incorrect because instance store volumes are not persistent and will be lost if the instance is terminated or stopped.
