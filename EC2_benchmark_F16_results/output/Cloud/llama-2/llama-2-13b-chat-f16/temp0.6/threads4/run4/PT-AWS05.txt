A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:
Option C is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements because it allows for real-time monitoring of changes made to the items in DynamoDB, and automatically triggers a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach does not require setting up DynamoDB Accelerator or enabling Point-in-Time Recovery, which are not necessary for this specific use case. Additionally, using Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as CloudWatch Events) provides a centralized event bus that can be used to handle events from multiple sources, such as DynamoDB and other AWS services.
