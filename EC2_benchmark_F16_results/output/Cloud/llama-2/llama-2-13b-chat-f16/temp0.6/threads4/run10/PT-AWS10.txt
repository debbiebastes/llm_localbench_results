Answer: 

The correct answer is (C) Operations Perspective.

When migrating to AWS, it is essential to ensure that the company's operations are not disrupted and that their applications run smoothly in the cloud. This includes tasks such as capacity planning, performance optimization, and monitoring and logging. The Operations Perspective of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework provides guidance on how to perform these tasks, ensuring a smooth and efficient migration.
