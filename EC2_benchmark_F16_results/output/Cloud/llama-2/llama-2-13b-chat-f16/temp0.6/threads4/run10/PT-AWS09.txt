A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:

Option A is not a good choice because it would involve migrating from a serverless architecture to a more traditional, resource-intensive one. This would add complexity and increase costs without addressing the root issue of traffic spikes.

Option C would also not be effective in this scenario, as CloudFront is primarily intended for serving static content, not caching dynamic API responses.

Option D would provide some benefits, but it would not directly address the issue of traffic spikes.

Enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway would allow for more precise control over the number of requests handled by the backend systems, preventing them from being overwhelmed due to sudden traffic increases. Additionally, caching can help reduce the load on the backend by storing frequently requested data closer to users. This solution is therefore the most appropriate one for protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes in this scenario.
