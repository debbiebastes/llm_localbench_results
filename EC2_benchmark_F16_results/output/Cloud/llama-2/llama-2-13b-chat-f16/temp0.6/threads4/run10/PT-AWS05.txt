A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

Option C is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements because it allows for real-time tracking of new changes made to items in DynamoDB, without the need for manual intervention or additional infrastructure setup. By creating an Amazon EventBridge rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, any new changes made to items in the table will trigger the Lambda function associated with the rule, allowing the developer to process and save the new changes to the other table.

Option A (Setting up DynamoDB Accelerator) is not relevant to this scenario as it only provides performance optimizations for read-heavy workloads, and does not address the requirement of recording and storing new changes in another region.

Option B (Enabling DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery) would allow for restoring a table to a specific point in time, but would not provide real-time tracking of new changes made to items in the table. Additionally, it would require manual intervention to trigger the recovery process, which goes against the requirement of automating the process.

Option D (Enabling DynamoDB Streams) would allow for real-time processing of new changes made to items in DynamoDB, but would require additional infrastructure setup and manual configuration of a Lambda function to process the stream events. This approach is less ideal than option C as it requires more effort and resources to set up and maintain.
