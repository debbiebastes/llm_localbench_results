A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:
The most cost-effective option would be to choose the No Upfront, Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option allows you to pay hourly usage fees instead of an upfront fee, which can help reduce costs if the application is used for more than three years. The convertible feature also provides flexibility in case the instance type or region needs to be changed later on.
