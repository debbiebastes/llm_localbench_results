Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

B

Rationale: With six open shards, each instance can process three shards. Therefore, the maximum number of instances that can be launched is 2 \* 6 = 12. Launching more than 12 instances will not improve performance and may result in increased costs and complexities.
