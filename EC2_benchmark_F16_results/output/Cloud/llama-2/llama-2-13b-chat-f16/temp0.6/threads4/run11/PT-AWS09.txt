A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.

Explanation:
Using CloudFront in front of the API Gateway can help protect the backend systems from traffic spikes by acting as a cache. This will help reduce the number of requests that need to be made to the backend systems, which will help reduce the load on the systems and prevent them from becoming overwhelmed. Additionally, CloudFront can also help improve the performance of the platform by serving content from locations closer to the users.

Option (A) is not a good solution because it would require significant changes to the existing architecture and may introduce additional complexity and costs. Option (B) may help reduce the load on the backend systems but may not be enough to handle a large spike in traffic. Option (D) does not directly address the issue of protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes.
