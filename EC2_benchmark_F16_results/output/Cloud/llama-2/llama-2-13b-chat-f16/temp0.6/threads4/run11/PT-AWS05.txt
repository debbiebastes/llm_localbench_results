A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

* Option A, setting up DynamoDB Accelerator, is not relevant for compliance requirements.
* Option B, enabling DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery, would create a copy of the table but would not track new changes made to the original table.
* Option D, enabling DynamoDB Streams, would require setting up additional infrastructure and would not be the most efficient solution for this use case.

Option C is the best choice as it allows for tracking table-level events in DynamoDB and processing new changes with a Lambda function. This approach provides a simple and cost-effective way to comply with the requirements while leveraging existing services and infrastructure.
