A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.

Explanation: The problem stated is that the application performance is slow during the start of the day, which indicates that the EC2 instances are not having enough memory resources available at that time. Therefore, launching new instances based on memory utilization would help to ensure that there is enough memory available for the running applications, ensuring better performance at the beginning of the day.

Option A is not the best solution as predictive scaling is not needed here as we don't know when the users will start using the application, Option C is not the best solution as scheduled scaling is not necessary here and option D is also not the best solution as CPU utilization is not related to the problem.
