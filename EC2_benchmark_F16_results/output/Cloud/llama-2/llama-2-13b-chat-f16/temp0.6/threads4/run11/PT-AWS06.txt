A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation: A 502 Bad Gateway error typically indicates that there's a problem with the server acting as a gateway, and this issue is related to the response from the backend Lambda function. The fact that the developer can invoke the underlying function properly suggests that the issue is not related to the function itself but rather to the output it returns. Therefore, option (A) is the most likely root cause of the problem.
