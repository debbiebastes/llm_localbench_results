An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B

Explanation:

To meet the requirement of a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, you should use an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume. EBS volumes are designed for use as persistent storage with EC2 instances and provide a highly available and durable storage option.

Option B is the correct answer because it recommends using an EBS volume in your EC2 instance to store your backup data, which will be stored in Amazon S3 using a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. This approach meets the requirement of using an EBS volume for persistent block storage and also provides a cost-effective solution for storing backup data.

Option A is incorrect because instance store volumes are designed for temporary storage and are not suitable for mission-critical workloads. Option C is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a storage class that provides the same level of durability and availability as Amazon S3 Glacier. Option D is incorrect because there is no such option to attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance.
