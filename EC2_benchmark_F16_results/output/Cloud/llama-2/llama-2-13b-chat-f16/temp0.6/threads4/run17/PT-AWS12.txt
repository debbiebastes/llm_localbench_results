A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:
If the application will be used for more than 3 years, the most cost-effective option would be to choose the No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option offers the lowest total cost of ownership as it eliminates the upfront fee and provides a discounted hourly rate for the entire 3-year term. The convertible feature allows the reservation to be converted into a different instance type or operating system if needed, providing flexibility and future proofing.

In comparison, option (A) would have the highest total cost of ownership due to the upfront fee, even though it offers the lowest hourly rate for the 1-year term. Option (C) would also have a higher total cost of ownership than option (B), despite offering a lower hourly rate, due to the upfront fee and the shorter term. Option (D) is not the most cost-effective option as it would require renewing the reservation every year, potentially resulting in higher costs over time.
