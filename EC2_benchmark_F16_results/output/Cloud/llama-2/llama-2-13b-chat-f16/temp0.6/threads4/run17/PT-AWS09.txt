A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:

To protect the backend systems from traffic spikes, it is recommended to enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway. Throttling limits can be set to limit the number of requests that can be made within a specific time frame, while result caching can help reduce the load on the backend systems by storing frequently accessed data in memory.

Option A is not a good choice as it would require significant changes to the current architecture and may not provide immediate relief from traffic spikes. Option C may not be effective in reducing the load on the backend systems, and Option D may not be necessary for this scenario.
