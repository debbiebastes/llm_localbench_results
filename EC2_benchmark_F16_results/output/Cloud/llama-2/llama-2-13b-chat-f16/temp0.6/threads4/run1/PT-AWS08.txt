An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

The correct answer is B. Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Option A is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads and do not support persistence.

Option C is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA does not provide the required persistence and data archiving capabilities.

Option D is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads and do not support persistence.

Attaching an EBS volume to your EC2 instance will provide a persistent block storage volume that can be used for your mission-critical workload. Using Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier will provide a cost-effective and scalable solution for long-term data archiving.
