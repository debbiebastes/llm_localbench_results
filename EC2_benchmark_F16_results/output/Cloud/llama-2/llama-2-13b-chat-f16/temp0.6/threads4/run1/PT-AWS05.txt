A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:
EventBridge is a serverless event bus that provides a centralized way to collect, process, and act on events from multiple sources within AWS, including DynamoDB. By creating an EventBridge rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, you can automatically detect new changes made to items in the table and have those changes written to another table in another region. This approach is more ideal than using DynamoDB Accelerator or enabling Point-in-Time Recovery because it allows for real-time processing of changes and does not require additional infrastructure setup or maintenance. Additionally, using a Lambda function as the rule target provides a serverless and scalable way to process the events without the need for manual intervention.
