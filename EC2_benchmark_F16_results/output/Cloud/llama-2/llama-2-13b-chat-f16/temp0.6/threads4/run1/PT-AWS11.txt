Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 

The correct answer is B. Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).

Explanation:

Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed event bus that allows you to subscribe to events generated by AWS services, custom applications, and other resources within your AWS account.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service), Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service), and Amazon Kinesis are all AWS services that enable message queuing and communication between microservices, but they do not provide the same level of event-driven architecture as EventBridge.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).
