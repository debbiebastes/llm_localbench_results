A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation: When a Lambda function returns an incompatible output format, it can cause a 502 Bad Gateway error. The output of the Lambda function must match the expected output format of the API Gateway. In this case, the developer stated that the Lambda function properly returned the result in XML format, indicating that the issue is likely with the output format being returned by the Lambda function and not with the invocation of the function itself.
