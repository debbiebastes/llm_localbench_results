A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation: 

To comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company, it is recommended to use a KMS-managed customer master key for encrypting the sensitive PII data stored in the Amazon S3 bucket. This approach ensures that the master keys are never sent to AWS, as they are managed by the client-side KMS.

Option (A) and Option (C) do not meet the requirement of keeping the master keys on the client side, as they rely on customer-provided keys or server-side encryption respectively. Option (D) is not a valid option for S3 encryption.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.
