A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances.

Rationale: A predictive scaling policy is the most operationally efficient solution because it allows the application to scale proactively based on historical usage patterns and forecasted demand, rather than reactively based on current resource utilization. This approach ensures that the application has the necessary resources to handle the increased traffic at the start of the day, without overprovisioning or underprovisioning resources.

Explanation:

* (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on Memory utilization is not the most operationally efficient solution because it may lead to overprovisioning of resources, as memory usage may vary greatly depending on the workload.
* (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day is not the most operationally efficient solution because it may lead to underprovisioning of resources during periods of unexpectedly high demand.
* (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on CPU utilization is not the most operationally efficient solution because it may lead to overprovisioning of resources, as CPU usage may vary greatly depending on the workload.
