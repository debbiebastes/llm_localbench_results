A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C

Explanation:

Option C is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements because it allows for real-time tracking of changes made to items in DynamoDB, without the need for manual intervention or additional infrastructure. By using Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) and a Lambda function, new changes can be automatically processed and saved to the other table. This approach also provides flexibility and scalability, as it can handle large volumes of data and scale up or down as needed.

Option A is not ideal because DynamoDB Accelerator does not provide real-time tracking of changes. It only provides faster read performance for frequently accessed data.

Option B is not ideal because DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery is intended for disaster recovery and does not provide real-time tracking of changes. It also requires manual intervention to set up and maintain the synchronization process.

Option D is not ideal because DynamoDB Streams require additional infrastructure setup and maintenance, and may not be as scalable or flexible as using Amazon EventBridge and a Lambda function.
