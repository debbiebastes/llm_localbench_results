An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

The correct answer is B: Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

EBS (Elastic Block Store) volumes provide persistent block storage for EC2 instances, which is suitable for mission-critical workloads. Attaching an EBS volume in the existing EC2 instance will provide a persistent storage solution that can be used for backup data.

Using Amazon S3 to store the backup data provides a highly available and durable storage solution. Configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days will help reduce storage costs by moving infrequently accessed data to a lower-cost storage class.

Option A is incorrect because instance store volumes are temporary storage that is specific to the instance and are not suitable for mission-critical workloads. Option C is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a storage class that provides Infrequent Access (IA) storage, which is not suitable for backup data that needs to be accessed frequently. Option D is incorrect because instance store volumes are temporary storage that is specific to the instance and are not suitable for mission-critical workloads.
