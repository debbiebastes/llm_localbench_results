A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
(A) Using AWS Config rules to automatically detect and remediate the security risk is the most efficient way.

Explanation:

Option (A) is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk because it uses AWS Config rules to detect the security group that allows inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range and associates a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function to update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is automated and can be triggered by AWS Config, which can monitor the security groups for any changes and remediate them in real-time.

Option (B) setting up a Transit VPC is not an efficient way to remediate this risk because it requires additional setup and configuration of the Transit VPC, and it may not be able to detect all instances that allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Option (C) blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL is not a scalable solution as it would require frequent updates to the Network ACL to include all instances that allow traffic directly from the Internet.

Option (D) using AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is not a proactive solution as it only provides detection and alerting capabilities, but does not provide automated remediation.
