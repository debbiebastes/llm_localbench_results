Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Explanation:

Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed service for event bus, event pattern, and event filter, allowing you to connect various AWS services and custom applications through events.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queue service that enables you to decouple components of your application, but it does not provide event-driven architecture.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a fully managed messaging service that sends messages or push notifications to multiple subscribers or clients, but it does not provide event-driven architecture.

Amazon Kinesis is a data streaming service that enables you to build real-time data pipelines and applications, but it does not provide event-driven architecture.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).
