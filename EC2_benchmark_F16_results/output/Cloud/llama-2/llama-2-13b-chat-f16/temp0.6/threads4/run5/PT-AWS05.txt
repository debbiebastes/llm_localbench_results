A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 

C) Creating an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements. This approach allows for real-time processing of new changes without the need to manually configure a Lambda function or enable Point-in-Time Recovery. Additionally, EventBridge provides a centralized event bus that can be used to trigger actions on multiple services, making it easier to manage and monitor events across the application.

Explanation:

* Option A is not ideal because DynamoDB Accelerator is designed for high-throughput reads and writes, but it does not provide real-time event processing or storage of new changes in another table.
* Option B requires manual configuration of Point-in-Time Recovery, which can be error-prone and may not provide real-time event processing.
* Option D requires the use of DynamoDB Streams, which can be more complex to set up and manage compared to EventBridge. Additionally, Streams may require more resources and infrastructure to handle the volume of events.
