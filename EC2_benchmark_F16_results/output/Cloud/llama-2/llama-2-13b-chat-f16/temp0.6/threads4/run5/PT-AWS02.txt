The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is option (C): Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes. 

This solution allows the IT Security team to quickly and efficiently deploy the necessary patches to mitigate the security risk, while also providing a centralized and automated way of tracking and recording all changes made to the EC2 instances for audit purposes. Additionally, using AWS Config provides a reliable and secure method of recording and tracking configuration changes.

The other options are not suitable for this scenario:

Option (A) would require additional setup and integration with Kibana, which may not be feasible within the time frame required to mitigate the security risk. 

Option (B) would require setting up an Elastic Search cluster, which could also be time-consuming and may not be feasible within the required time frame.

Option (D) would not provide a centralized and automated way of tracking and recording all changes made to the EC2 instances for audit purposes.
