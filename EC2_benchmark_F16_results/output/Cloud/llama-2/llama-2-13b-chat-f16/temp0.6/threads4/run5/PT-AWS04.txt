Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12

Rationale: To achieve optimum performance, each KCL worker should have one shard. With six open shards, you can launch six EC2 instances to ensure that each instance is processing one shard. Launching more than six instances will not improve performance as each worker can only process one shard. Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch is 12.
