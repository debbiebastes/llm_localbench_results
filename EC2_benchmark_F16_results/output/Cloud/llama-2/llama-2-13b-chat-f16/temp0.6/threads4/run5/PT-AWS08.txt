An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

An Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume is a persistent storage solution that is suitable for mission-critical workloads. Attaching an EBS volume to an EC2 instance will provide persistent block-level storage that can be used for storing backup data.

Option B is the correct answer because it suggests attaching an EBS volume to the EC2 instance and using Amazon S3 to store the backup data, which meets the requirement of a persistent block storage volume. Additionally, configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier will provide long-term storage for the backup data after 30 days, as required.

Option A is incorrect because an instance store volume is not suitable for mission-critical workloads and does not provide persistent block-level storage. Option C is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a long-term storage solution and would not meet the requirement of storing backup data for 30 days before transitioning to long-term storage. Option D is incorrect because attaching an instance store volume to an EC2 instance will not provide persistent block-level storage.
