A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Correct Answer: (A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:

The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is to use AWS Config rules to detect and update the security groups that allow traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. AWS Config provides a feature called "Resource-based Configuration" which allows you to define configurations for specific resources in your AWS environment, such as security groups.

By defining an AWS Config rule that checks for security groups with inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, you can automatically detect and remediate any security groups that allow this type of traffic. Additionally, you can associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This will ensure that all traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is blocked and that only traffic from the corporate firewall is allowed.

Option (B) setting up a Transit VPC does not address the issue of security groups allowing inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Option (C) blocking the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACLs will block all traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which may not be desired if there are legitimate sources that need to access the EC2 instances. Option (D) using AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups allowing traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CID
