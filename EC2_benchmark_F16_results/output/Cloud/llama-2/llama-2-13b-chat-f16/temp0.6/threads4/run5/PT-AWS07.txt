A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation:

In this scenario, the application performance is slow at the beginning of the day due to insufficient resources (e.g., instance types and sizes). To address this issue, the most operationally efficient solution would be to configure a Scheduled scaling policy that launches new instances before the start of the day when user traffic is low.

Option (A) Predictive scaling policy may not be effective in this scenario as it relies on historical data to predict the future usage patterns, which may not accurately capture the increased demand during the start of the day.

Option (B) Dynamic scaling based on Memory utilization may not be effective either since the memory usage may not be the primary bottleneck during the start of the day when the application is experiencing a sudden increase in user traffic.

Option (D) Dynamic scaling based on CPU utilization may also not be effective as it may lead to over-provisioning instances with higher CPU specifications that are not necessary for the workload.

Therefore, configuring a Scheduled scaling policy that launches new instances before the start of the day is the most operationally efficient solution to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day. This approach allows for the provisioning of additional resources in advance when user traffic is low, thereby ensuring that the application can handle the increased demand during the start of the day without any performance issues.
