A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:

API Gateway provides features such as throttling limits and result caching that can help protect backend systems from traffic spikes. Throttling limits can be used to limit the number of requests that can be made to the backend system within a certain time period, while result caching can store the results of previous requests in memory, reducing the need for additional requests to the backend system.

Option (A) is not the best choice because it would require significant changes to the existing architecture, and Option (C) would not provide any direct protection for the backend systems. Option (D) would only move the Lambda function to a VPC, which would not address the issue of traffic spikes.
