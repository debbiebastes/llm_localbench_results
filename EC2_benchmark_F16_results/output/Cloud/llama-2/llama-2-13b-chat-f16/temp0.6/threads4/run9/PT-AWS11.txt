Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Explanation:

Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed event bus that allows you to communicate between different services in your application, such as microservices or serverless functions.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queue service that allows you to decouple the components of your application, but it does not provide an event bus. Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a messaging service that sends messages or push notifications to multiple subscribers or clients, but it is not designed for building event-driven applications. Amazon Kinesis is a streaming service that allows you to build real-time data pipelines, but it does not provide an event bus.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).
