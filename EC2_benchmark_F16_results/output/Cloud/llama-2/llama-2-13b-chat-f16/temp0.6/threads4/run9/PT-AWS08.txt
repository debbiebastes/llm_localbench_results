An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B. Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

EBS (Elastic Block Store) volumes are persistent block storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances. They provide a highly available and durable storage solution for mission-critical workloads.

Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides scalable and durable storage for backups. It has a lifecycle policy feature that allows you to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which is a low-cost storage class designed for long-term archiving.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer because it meets the requirements of persistent block storage and object storage with a lifecycle policy for backup data. Option A uses instance store volumes, which are not persistent and may not meet the needs of mission-critical workloads. Options C and D do not use Amazon S3 for backup storage.
