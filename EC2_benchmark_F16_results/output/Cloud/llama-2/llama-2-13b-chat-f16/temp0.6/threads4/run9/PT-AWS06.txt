A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation: When there is a bad gateway error, it usually indicates that there's an issue with the server acting as the gateway. In this case, the issue is likely related to the output of the Lambda function being incompatible with the API Gateway proxy. The developer stated that the underlying function properly returned the result in XML format, which suggests that the issue may be related to the output format being incorrect for the API Gateway proxy. Therefore, option (A) is the most likely root cause of the issue.
