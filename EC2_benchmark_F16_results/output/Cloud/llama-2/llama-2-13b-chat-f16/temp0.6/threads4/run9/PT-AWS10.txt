An e-commerce company wants to migrate its on-premise infrastructure to Amazon Web Services. However, they are worried about ensuring their migration is secure and efficient.

Which of the following AWS Cloud Adoption Framework perspective would be the most essential for the companyâ€™s migration?

(A) Security Perspective
(B) Governance Perspective
(C) Operations Perspective
(D) Platform Perspective

Answer: 
(C) Operations Perspective

Rationale: The operations perspective is concerned with the design, deployment, and operation of the workloads in AWS. This includes infrastructure setup, resource management, networking, monitoring, and security. Since the company wants to migrate its on-premise infrastructure to AWS, ensuring efficient operations is critical to their migration.

The security perspective would also be important, as it addresses security controls and compliance requirements. However, since the company has already expressed concern about security, the operations perspective would be the most essential for their migration.
