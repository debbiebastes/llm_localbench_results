A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

The MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day is option C: Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation: A scheduled scaling policy allows you to specify a schedule for when you want Amazon EC2 instances to be launched or terminated, based on a set of conditions that you define. By launching new instances before the start of the day, you can ensure that the application has enough resources available to handle the increased traffic during the morning hours.

Option A is not the best choice because a predictive scaling policy is designed to adjust the number of instances based on forecasted usage, which may not be effective in this case since the traffic patterns are known and consistent.

Option B is also not the best choice because dynamic scaling based on memory utilization may not be effective in this case since the application's performance issues are occurring during the start of the day when there is no significant increase in memory usage.

Option D is not the best choice because dynamic scaling based on CPU utilization may not be effective in this case since the application's performance issues are occurring during the start of the day when there is no significant increase in CPU usage.
