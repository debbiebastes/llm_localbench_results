The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:

In this scenario, the immediate need is to mitigate the security risk by applying OS patches to the outdated EC2 instances. AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides a convenient solution to deploy the patches across multiple instances. Additionally, using AWS Config to record and track configuration changes ensures compliance and auditing purposes.

Option (A) does not address the immediate security risk, as it only provides a long-term solution with integration to Kibana. Option (B) also does not provide an easy solution for patch deployment. Option (D) is not suitable as it would not address the compliance and auditing requirements.
