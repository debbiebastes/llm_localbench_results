An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B. Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Option B is the best choice for meeting the requirement of a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, as EBS volumes provide persistent block storage that can be attached to an EC2 instance. Additionally, using Amazon S3 to store backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier will provide a cost-effective solution for long-term data archiving.

Option A is not a good choice because instance stores are temporary block storage volumes that are lost when the EC2 instance is terminated, and they do not provide persistent storage.

Option C is not a good choice because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA does not provide long-term data archiving, and it is designed for infrequently accessed data that needs to be stored in a single region.

Option D is not a good choice because instance store volumes are temporary block storage volumes that are lost when the EC2 instance is terminated, and they do not provide persistent storage.
