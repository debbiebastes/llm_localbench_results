A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:

API Gateway can help protect backend systems from traffic spikes by enabling throttling limits and result caching. Throttling limits can be set to limit the number of requests that a client can make within a certain time frame, preventing denial of service (DoS) attacks and excessive usage of resources. Result caching can store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need for backend systems to handle repeated requests and freeing up resources.

Option A is not the best choice as it involves changing the architecture of the platform, which may not be feasible or desirable given the time constraints. Option C does not address the issue of traffic spikes and excessive usage of resources. Option D would not directly impact the protection of backend systems from traffic spikes.
