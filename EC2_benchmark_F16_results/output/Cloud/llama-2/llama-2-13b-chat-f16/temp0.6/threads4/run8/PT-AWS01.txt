A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:

The best option for the security engineer would be to implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This method allows the hospital's security team to manage and control access to the encryption keys, while also leveraging the scalability and durability of AWS. Additionally, using a KMS-managed master key ensures that the key is securely stored and managed within AWS, which complies with the strict regulatory requirements of the company.

Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a customer-provided key (Option D) would not be appropriate as it would require storing the encryption keys outside of AWS, which would not meet the regulatory requirements.

Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS-managed key (Option C) would also not be appropriate as it would require the security team to manage access to the encryption keys on the AWS side, which would not provide the desired level of control and compliance.

Therefore, option B is the best choice for implementing S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.
