Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(C) 3

Explanation:

If you increase the number of open shards from four to six, but keep the number of KCL workers per instance constant at one, then the processing capacity of each EC2 instance will be split across three shards instead of one. This means that each instance will be able to process only one-third of the total volume of data, resulting in lower performance.

Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance is three (3).
