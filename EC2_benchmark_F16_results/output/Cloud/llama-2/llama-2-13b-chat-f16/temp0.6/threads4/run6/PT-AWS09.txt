A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Rationale:
Enabling throttling limits in API Gateway can help regulate traffic to the backend systems, preventing sudden surges from overwhelming them. Result caching can also help reduce the load on the backend by storing frequently requested data in memory. This approach is less expensive and more efficient compared to switching to a more scalable architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling (A). Using CloudFront in front of API Gateway to act as a cache may not be necessary for this scenario. Moving the Lambda function in a VPC (D) may also be required but is not directly related to protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes.
