An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

Correct answer is B - Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

For a persistent block storage volume, you should use an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume instead of an instance store volume. EBS volumes provide a more durable and highly available storage option compared to instance store volumes.

Amazon S3 is a suitable choice for storing backup data, and you can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. This will help reduce storage costs by moving older data to a more cost-effective storage class.

Option A is incorrect because instance store volumes are not persistent and are not suitable for mission-critical workloads.

Option C is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a storage class that supports long-term data archiving like Amazon S3 Glacier does.

Option D is incorrect because there is no option to attach an instance store volume in an EC2 instance.
