A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:

The best option would be to go with the No Upfront, Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option offers the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to the other options. Here's why:

* All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term (Option A) has the highest TCO since you pay the full amount upfront, which is not ideal if you plan to use the instance for more than 3 years.
* No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term (Option C) has a higher TCO compared to Option B since you pay a higher hourly rate for the instances over the 3-year period.
* No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year (Option D) would result in higher costs over time since you'd be paying the higher on-demand rates each year.

In contrast, Option B offers the lowest hourly rate for the instances, which results in the lowest TCO over the 3-year period. Additionally, with a Convertible Reserved Instance, you can change the instance type or switch between On-Demand and Reserved Instances as needed, providing flexibility and cost savings.
