A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation: When the developer received a 502 Bad Gateway error, it indicates that the API Gateway could not successfully communicate with the backend (the Lambda function). The fact that the underlying function properly returned the result in XML format suggests that there is an issue with the output format being returned from the Lambda function. Since the developer configured the proxy integration to work with a Lambda function, it is likely that the issue is related to the output format being incompatible with the API Gateway. Therefore, option A is the most likely root cause of this issue.
