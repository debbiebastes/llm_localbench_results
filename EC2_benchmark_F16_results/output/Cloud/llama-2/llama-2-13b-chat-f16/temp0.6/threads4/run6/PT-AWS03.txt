A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:

Option A is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk because it allows for real-time detection and automated remediation of security groups that allow traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. By using AWS Config rules, the system can detect when a security group is configured to allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range and automatically update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach eliminates the need for manual monitoring and remediation, reducing the likelihood of human error and increasing the speed of response.

Option B is not the most efficient way to remediate this risk because it requires setting up a Transit VPC, which can be a complex and time-consuming process. Additionally, this option does not provide real-time detection and automated remediation capabilities.

Option C is not the most efficient way to remediate this risk because blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range may not be feasible, as it can affect legitimate traffic. Moreover, this option does not provide real-time detection and automated remediation capabilities.

Option D is not the most efficient way to remediate this risk because AWS Shield is a security service that provides DDoS protection, not a solution for automatically detecting and remediating security group configuration issues.
