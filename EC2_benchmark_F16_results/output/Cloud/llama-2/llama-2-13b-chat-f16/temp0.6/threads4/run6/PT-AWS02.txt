The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

The most suitable solution in this scenario is option (C). Using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances and setting up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes provides an effective and efficient way to mitigate security risks and maintain compliance.

Explanation:

Option A does not address the issue of recording and tracking configuration changes for audit purposes, while option B uses Amazon ES which is not a suitable solution for this scenario. Option D does not provide a comprehensive approach to patch management and does not address the need for compliance recording.

AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides a simple way to deploy OS patches across EC2 instances, while AWS Config allows for tracking and recording of configuration changes. Together, they provide a complete solution for mitigating security risks and maintaining compliance.
