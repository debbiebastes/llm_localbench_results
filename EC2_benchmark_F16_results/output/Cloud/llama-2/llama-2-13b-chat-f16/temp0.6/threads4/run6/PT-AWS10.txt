Which of the following AWS Cloud Adoption Framework perspective would be the most essential for the companyâ€™s migration?

Answer: 
(C) Operations Perspective

Rationale: The Operations Perspective of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework focuses on the technical aspects of cloud adoption and ensures that the migration is efficient, reliable, and secure.
