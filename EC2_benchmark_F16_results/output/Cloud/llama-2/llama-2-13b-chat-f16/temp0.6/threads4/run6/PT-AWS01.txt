A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:
The most secure option to store sensitive PII data in an S3 bucket is by using a KMS-managed customer master key for client-side encryption. This approach ensures that the master key is never sent to AWS, and only the encrypted data is stored in the S3 bucket. Additionally, using a KMS-managed key provides an additional layer of security and control over access to the encrypted data.

Option A is not recommended as it would require the client-side master key to be generated and managed on the application server, which could increase the risk of key exposure or loss.

Option C is not recommended as it would require AWS to manage the encryption keys, which goes against the requirement of never sending the master keys to AWS.

Option D is not relevant as there is no option for customer-provided encryption keys for S3 buckets.
