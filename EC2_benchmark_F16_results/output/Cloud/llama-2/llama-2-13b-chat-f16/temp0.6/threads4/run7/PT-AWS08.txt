An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B

Explanation:

Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) is a block-level storage volume that is designed for use with EC2 instances. It provides persistent storage for data and can be attached to an existing EC2 instance. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object store that provides scalable storage for static assets, such as backup data.

To meet the requirement of a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, option B is the best choice. This option attaches an EBS volume to the EC2 instance and uses Amazon S3 to store the backup data. The lifecycle policy can be configured to transition the objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which will help reduce storage costs and ensure long-term data retention.

Option A is not suitable because an instance store volume is a temporary storage solution that is tied to the lifetime of the EC2 instance. Option C is also not suitable because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a storage class that provides infrequent access to data, which may not be appropriate for mission-critical workloads. Option D is not a valid option because it does not provide a persistent block storage volume.
