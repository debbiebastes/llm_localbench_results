A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Rationale: In this scenario, the Security Engineer should use a KMS-managed customer master key to encrypt the data before it is sent to AWS. This ensures that the sensitive PII data remains protected and secure throughout the transmission process. The client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key provides an additional layer of security as the master key is never sent to AWS, thereby reducing the risk of data breach or unauthorized access.

Note: (A) and (D) are not correct options as they do not meet the requirement of never sending the master keys to AWS. Option (C) is incorrect because it uses a server-side encryption which may not be suitable for client-side encryption.
