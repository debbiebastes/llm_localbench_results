A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Rationale: 
Option C is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements because it allows for real-time replication of new changes made to items in DynamoDB without the need for manual intervention or complex setup. EventBridge provides a centralized event bus that can collect and process events from various AWS services, including DynamoDB. By creating an EventBridge rule that triggers on table-level events in DynamoDB, the new changes can be captured and passed to a Lambda function for processing and storing in the other DynamoDB table. This approach is more efficient and scalable than using Point-in-Time Recovery or DynamoDB Accelerator, which require manual intervention and additional setup. Additionally, this solution provides a more streamlined and automated way of complying with IT compliance requirements compared to manually syncing the tables or using a third-party tool.
