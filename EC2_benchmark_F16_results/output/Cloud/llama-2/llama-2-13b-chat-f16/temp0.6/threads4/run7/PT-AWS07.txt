A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Rationale: A scheduled scaling policy allows you to specify when you want Amazon EC2 instances to be added or removed from your Auto Scaling group, based on a recurring schedule. By setting up a scheduled scaling policy to launch new instances before the start of the day, you can ensure that the application has enough capacity to handle the increased traffic during the morning hours. This approach is more operationally efficient than other options because it allows you to proactively scale your resources based on a predictable schedule, rather than reacting to changing conditions or using complex scaling rules.
