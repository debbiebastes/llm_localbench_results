Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events), an AWS service, enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It allows you to integrate your applications with other AWS services and custom events from your own applications or microservices.

Amazon SQS is a message queue service that enables you to decouple components of your application architecture, but it does not provide event-driven functionality.

Amazon SNS is a messaging service that sends messages or push notifications to multiple subscribers or clients, but it does not enable event-driven architecture.

Amazon Kinesis is a streaming service that enables you to collect and process large amounts of data from various sources, but it does not provide event-driven functionality.
