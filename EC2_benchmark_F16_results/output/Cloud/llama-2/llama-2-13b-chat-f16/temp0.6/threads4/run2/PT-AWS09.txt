A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:

Option A is not a good choice because it would require significant changes to the existing architecture, which may not be feasible or desirable.

Option C would only provide caching for certain types of requests, and would not address the issue of high traffic volumes.

Option D would not directly address the issue of traffic spikes, but could potentially help with security.

Enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway can help protect the backend systems from traffic spikes by limiting the number of requests that are allowed to reach the backend, and caching the results of frequently requested queries to reduce the load on the backend. This can help prevent the backend systems from being overwhelmed and becoming unavailable due to high traffic volumes.
