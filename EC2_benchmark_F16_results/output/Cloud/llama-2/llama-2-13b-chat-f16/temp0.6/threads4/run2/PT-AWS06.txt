A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation: When a Lambda function is used as a backend for an API Gateway proxy, the output of the Lambda function must be in a format that is compatible with the content handler specified in the API Gateway configuration. If the output is not compatible, it will cause a 502 Bad Gateway error. Therefore, option (A) is the most likely root cause of this issue.
