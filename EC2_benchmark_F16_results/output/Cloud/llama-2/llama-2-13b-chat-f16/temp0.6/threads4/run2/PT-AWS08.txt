An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B is the correct answer.

Explanation:

Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) volumes provide persistent block-level storage for EC2 instances, which can be used for mission-critical workloads. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) provides object-level storage, and objects in S3 can be transitioned to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days using a lifecycle policy.

Therefore, option B is the best answer as it meets all the requirements:

* Persistent block-level storage for mission-critical workloads (provided by EBS)
* Object-level storage for backup data (provided by S3)
* Lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days.
