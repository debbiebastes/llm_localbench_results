A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation: The answer is B, as this option meets the requirement of never sending the master keys or unencrypted data to AWS, while also utilizing AWS's KMS service for secure management of the master keys. By using a KMS-managed customer master key, the Security Engineer can ensure that the master keys are not stored on AWS, and only accessible by the client-side application. This ensures that the sensitive PII data is encrypted at rest in S3, while also meeting the regulatory requirements of the company.

Note: Options A, C, and D do not meet the requirement of never sending the master keys or unencrypted data to AWS, as they all involve storing or transmitting the master keys or unencrypted data to AWS at some point.
