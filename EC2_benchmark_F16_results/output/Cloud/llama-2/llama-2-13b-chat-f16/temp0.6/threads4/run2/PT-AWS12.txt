A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation: The No Upfront option provides the lowest cost option since there is no upfront payment required. The Convertible option allows the customer to change the instance type, operating system or tenancy status within the same family of instances at any time without penalty. Since the application will be used for more than 3 years, it makes sense to opt for a longer term and save on costs over time.
