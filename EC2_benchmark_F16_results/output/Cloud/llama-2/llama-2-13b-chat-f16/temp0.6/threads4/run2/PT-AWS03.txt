A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is option (A). Here's why:

Option (B) setting up a Transit VPC would require additional infrastructure setup and configuration, which might not be the most efficient solution. Option (C) blocking source IP addresses using Network ACLs would also require additional configuration and might not be scalable.

Option (D) using AWS Shield to monitor security groups for direct traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is a good idea, but it's not a remediation solution as it only detects the issue, but doesn't automatically remediate it.

Option (A) using AWS Config rules and Systems Manager Automation documents associated with an AWS Lambda function can automatically detect and remediate security group configurations that allow inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. This approach is efficient because it leverages existing AWS services and automates the remediation process, reducing the need for manual intervention and minimizing the risk of human error.
