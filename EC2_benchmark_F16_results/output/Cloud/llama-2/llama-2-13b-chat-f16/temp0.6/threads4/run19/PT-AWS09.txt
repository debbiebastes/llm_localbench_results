A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.

Explanation:

Option A is not the best solution, as switching to EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling would require a significant overhaul of the existing architecture and may not provide the same level of scalability and availability as using CloudFront.

Option B is not the best solution either, as throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway would only help to limit the number of requests that reach the backend, but would not address the issue of traffic spikes.

Option D is not relevant to the scenario.

Using CloudFront in front of API Gateway can help to act as a cache and distribute incoming traffic across multiple edge locations, reducing the load on the backend systems and providing faster response times to users. This would be the best solution to protect the backend systems from traffic spikes.
