Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).

Explanation: Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed event bus that allows you to subscribe to events from various AWS services, such as EC2 instances terminating, S3 buckets changing, or DynamoDB tables updating. You can then trigger actions on these events in real-time using Amazon Lambda functions, AWS Step Functions, or other compute services.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queue service that allows you to decouple components of your application and handle messages asynchronously. However, it does not provide event-driven architecture like Amazon EventBridge.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a messaging service that sends notifications or messages to multiple subscribers or clients. It can be used for event-driven architecture but is not the best fit for building event-driven applications as it doesn't provide real-time event processing capabilities like Amazon EventBridge.

Amazon Kinesis is a data streaming service that allows you to build real-time data pipelines and process large amounts of data in motion. While it can be used for event-driven architecture, it is not the primary service designed for this purpose like Amazon EventBridge.
