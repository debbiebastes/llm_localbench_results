A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 

The MOST likely root cause of this issue is option (A), that there is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation: A 502 Bad Gateway error typically indicates that the API Gateway received an invalid or incomplete response from the upstream service (in this case, the Lambda function). If the output of the Lambda function is not in a format that the API Gateway expects, it will result in a 502 Bad Gateway error. Since the developer was able to invoke the underlying function and receive a proper result in XML format, it suggests that the issue lies with the integration between the Lambda function and the API Gateway. Therefore, option (A) is the most likely root cause of this issue.
