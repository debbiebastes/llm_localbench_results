Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12

Explanation:

To achieve optimal performance, you need to ensure that each KCL worker has enough capacity to process the incoming data. With six open shards, you have a total of six input streams that need to be processed.

Since each instance can only handle one KCL worker, you would need at least six instances to process all six input streams in parallel. Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch is 12 (6 instances x 2 workers per instance).

Option A (5) is incorrect because five instances would not be enough to process all six input streams. Option C (3) is also incorrect because three instances would not provide enough capacity to handle the increased volume of data. Option D (6) is the correct answer, but it is not the maximum number of instances that you should launch.
