A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:
The most cost-effective option for the company would be to go with the No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option offers the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO) as it eliminates the upfront payment and provides a discounted hourly rate for the three years of usage. The convertible feature allows the company to change the instance type or operating system as needed, providing flexibility and future proofing.

Option A, All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term, has a higher TCO due to the upfront payment. Option C, All Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term, also has a higher TCO due to the upfront payment and does not offer the convertible feature. Option D, No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year, may have a lower TCO in the short term but would result in higher costs over three years.
