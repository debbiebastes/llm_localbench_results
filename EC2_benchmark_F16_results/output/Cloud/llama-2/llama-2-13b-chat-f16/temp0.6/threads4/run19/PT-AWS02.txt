The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:

In this scenario, the most suitable solution is to use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances, as it provides a centralized and automated way to manage patching across multiple instances. Additionally, setting up AWS Config will allow for recording and tracking of any configuration changes made during the patching process, which is essential for audit purposes.

Option (A) does not address the specific need of recording and tracking configuration changes, while option (B) mentions using Amazon ES to record and track changes, but does not specifically mention AWS Config. Option (D) does not provide a centralized solution for patch management and may not be able to track changes across all instances.
