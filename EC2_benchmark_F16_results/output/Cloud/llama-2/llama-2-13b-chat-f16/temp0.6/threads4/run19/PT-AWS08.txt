An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a block-level storage service that provides persistent storage for EC2 instances. EBS volumes are attached to an instance and can be detached and reattached as needed.

To meet the requirement of a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, option (B) is the best choice. By attaching an EBS volume, you will have a reliable and highly available storage solution that can be used for both your backup data and mission-critical workloads.

Using Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days is also a good choice. Amazon S3 provides scalable object storage that can store large amounts of data, and Amazon S3 Glacier provides long-term archival storage at a lower cost.

Option (A) would not meet the requirement of persistent block storage because instance stores are temporary storage that is lost when the EC2 instance is terminated or rebooted. Option (C) would also not meet the requirement because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is an infrequently accessed storage service that is not designed for mission-critical workloads.

Option (D) would not meet the requirement of a persistent block storage volume because instance stores are temporary storage that is lost when the EC2 instance is terminated or rebooted.
