A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation: 

* Client-side encryption ensures that the data is encrypted on the client-side before it is sent to AWS, which helps to protect against unauthorized access during transit and at rest in S3.
* Using a KMS-managed customer master key provides an additional layer of security as the master key is managed by AWS Key Management Service (KMS), which ensures that it is securely stored, rotated regularly, and never leaves the control of the company.
* This approach also eliminates the need to store or manage the encryption keys on the client-side or in the application, reducing the risk of key exposure or loss.

Therefore, implementing an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key is the most secure and compliant option for storing sensitive PII data in AWS S3 bucket.
