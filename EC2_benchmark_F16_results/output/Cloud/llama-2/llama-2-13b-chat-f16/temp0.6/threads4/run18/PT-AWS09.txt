A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:

API Gateway provides features such as throttling, which can help protect the backend systems from traffic spikes. Throttling allows you to limit the number of requests that can be made within a certain time period, helping to prevent overload on the backend systems. Additionally, API Gateway supports result caching, which can help reduce the load on the backend systems by caching the results of frequently requested resources.

AWS Lambda and EC2 instances can also be used in conjunction with API Gateway to provide a more scalable and highly available architecture, but this is not the most appropriate solution for protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes. Enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway is a more straightforward and effective way to address this issue.

CloudFront cannot be used in front of API Gateway to act as a cache, as CloudFront only caches static assets such as images and videos, not dynamic content such as API responses. Moving the Lambda function in a VPC would not provide any direct benefits for protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes.
