(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation: 
If the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years, the most cost-effective option would be (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option offers the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO) as it eliminates upfront costs and provides discounts on hourly usage rates compared to other options.

Here's a breakdown of the TCO for each option:

* Option A (All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term): This option has the highest TCO as it requires a full upfront payment, which would be expensive for long-term usage. The hourly usage rates are lower compared to other options, but the total cost over 3 years is still higher due to the upfront payment.
* Option C (All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term): This option has a higher TCO than Option B as it requires a full upfront payment and offers lower hourly usage rates compared to Option B.
* Option D (No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year): This option has the highest TCO of all as it requires annual payments for 3 years, which would be more expensive than Option B's upfront payment.

Therefore, Option B (No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term) is the most cost-effective option for hosting an application for more than 3 years.
