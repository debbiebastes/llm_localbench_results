A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on Memory utilization.

Rationale:

The issue of slow performance at the start of the day is likely due to the increased load on the application during the morning hours when users are logging in. This can be addressed by launching additional instances with more memory to handle the increased demand. Dynamic scaling based on Memory utilization will allow the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of instances based on the available memory, ensuring that the application has sufficient resources to handle the morning rush.

(A) Predictive scaling would not be effective in this scenario as it relies on historical data and may not be able to predict the increased load at the start of the day.

(C) Scheduled scaling would not be effective in this scenario as it would launch new instances at a fixed time, regardless of the current load.

(D) Dynamic scaling based on CPU utilization would not be effective in this scenario as the issue is related to memory usage, not CPU usage.
