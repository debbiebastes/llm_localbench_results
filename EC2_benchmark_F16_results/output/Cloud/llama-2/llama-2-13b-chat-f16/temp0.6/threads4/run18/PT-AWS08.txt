An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation: 

* Option A is incorrect because instance store volumes are not persistent and can be lost when the instance is terminated or restarted.
* Option C is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a storage class that provides long-term data archiving.
* Option D is incorrect because option B is the correct answer.

Option B is the best choice for meeting the requirement of a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads. EBS volumes are persistent and provide the ability to configure lifecycle policies to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier, which is a cost-effective storage class for long-term data archiving.
