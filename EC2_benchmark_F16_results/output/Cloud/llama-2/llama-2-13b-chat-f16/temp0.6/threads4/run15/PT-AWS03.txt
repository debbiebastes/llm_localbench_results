A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:

Option A is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk because it leverages AWS Config rules to detect any security groups that allow traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and then associates a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function to update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is more efficient than manually reviewing and updating each security group, especially since there may be multiple security groups that need to be updated.

Option B, setting up a Transit VPC, would not directly remediate the security risk. Option C, blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, would also not directly remediate the security risk as it would only block traffic from known source IP addresses and not update the security groups to allow only traffic from the corporate firewall IP address. Option D, using AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, would be an additional layer of monitoring but would not automatically remediate the security risk.
