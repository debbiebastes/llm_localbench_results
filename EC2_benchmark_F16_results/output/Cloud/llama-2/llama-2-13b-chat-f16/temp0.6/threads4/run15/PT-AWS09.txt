A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

Correct Answer is (B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:
To protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes, it is recommended to enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway. Throttling limits can be set to control the number of requests that are allowed per unit of time, preventing the system from being overwhelmed by too many requests. Result caching can store the results of previous requests, reducing the load on the backend systems.

Option (A) is not a good solution because it would require significant changes to the existing architecture and may introduce additional complexity and costs. Option (C) is not relevant as CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) and does not provide the necessary functionality for handling traffic spikes. Option (D) does not address the issue of traffic spikes.
