Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a highly scalable, fully managed infrastructure for integrating with your application and handling events. With EventBridge, you can create event buses to route events between different microservices or applications, allowing them to communicate with each other without needing to know the details of each other's implementation.
