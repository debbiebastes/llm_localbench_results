An e-commerce company wants to migrate its on-premise infrastructure to Amazon Web Services. However, they are worried about ensuring their migration is secure and efficient.

Which of the following AWS Cloud Adoption Framework perspective would be the most essential for the company’s migration?

(A) Security Perspective
(B) Governance Perspective
(C) Operations Perspective
(D) Platform Perspective

Answer: 

The correct answer is (A) Security Perspective.

When migrating to AWS, security is a top concern for any organization. The Security Perspective of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework helps organizations ensure that their workloads and data are secure in the cloud. It provides guidelines and best practices for implementing security controls, such as identity and access management, encryption, network security, and compliance.

The Governance Perspective (B) focuses on establishing policies, processes, and procedures to ensure effective use of AWS services. The Operations Perspective (C) covers the day-to-day management of AWS resources, including monitoring, patching, and troubleshooting. Finally, the Platform Perspective (D) provides guidance on selecting the appropriate AWS services for the organization’s needs.

Therefore, the Security Perspective is the most essential for the company’s migration to ensure that their workloads and data are secure in the cloud.
