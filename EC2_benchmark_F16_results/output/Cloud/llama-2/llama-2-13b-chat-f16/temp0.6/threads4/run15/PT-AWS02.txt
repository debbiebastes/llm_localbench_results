The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the company’s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:
The best solution in this scenario is option C, which utilizes AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Patch Manager to deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. SSM Patch Manager provides a centralized way to manage patching across multiple instances, and it can automatically apply patches to instances that have the required software installed.

Additionally, option C recommends setting up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes. This will provide an audit trail of all changes made to the EC2 instances, which is essential for compliance purposes.

Option A does not provide a comprehensive solution for patching the outdated EC2 instances, as it only integrates with Kibana for visualization and analysis.

Option B does not offer a centralized way to manage patching across multiple instances and requires manual intervention to deploy patches.

Option D does not address the security risk posed by the outdated operating systems and does not provide any solution for recording and tracking configuration changes.
