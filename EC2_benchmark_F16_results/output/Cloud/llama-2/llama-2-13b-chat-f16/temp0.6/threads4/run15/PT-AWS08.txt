An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:
An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume provides persistent block-level storage for EC2 instances, which is suitable for mission-critical workloads. Amazon S3 is an object store that provides scalable and durable storage for backups. By attaching an EBS volume and using Amazon S3 to store backup data, the organization can meet its requirements for a persistent block storage volume and also take advantage of Amazon S3's features such as lifecycle policies to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier for long-term archiving.

Option A is not correct because instance store volumes are not designed for mission-critical workloads and are not suitable for storing large amounts of data. Option C is not correct because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a storage class that provides infrequently accessed storage, which may not be suitable for backup data that needs to be accessed frequently. Option D is not correct because instance store volumes are not designed for mission-critical workloads and are not suitable for storing large amounts of data.
