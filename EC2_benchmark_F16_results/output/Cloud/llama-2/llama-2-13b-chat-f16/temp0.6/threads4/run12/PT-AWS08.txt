An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B. Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Option B is the correct answer because it meets all the requirements mentioned in the question:

1. Persistent block storage volume: EBS provides persistent block-level storage that is suitable for mission-critical workloads.
2. Backup data stored in S3: S3 is a highly durable and secure object storage service that can store backup data.
3. Lifecycle policy to transition objects to Glacier: By configuring a lifecycle policy, you can automate the process of transitioning old objects to Amazon S3 Glacier, which provides long-term archiving at a lower cost.

Option A is not the correct answer because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads and cannot be used for backup data storage. Option C is also not the correct answer because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not designed for long-term archiving and does not provide the same level of durability as Glacier. Option D is not the correct answer because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads and cannot be used for backup data storage.
