A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

The MOST operationally efficient solution would be option (A) Configuring a predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances.

Rationale:

Predictive scaling allows you to forecast the future demand and adjust the instance capacity accordingly, so that the application can handle the expected workload. By using predictive scaling, the Auto Scaling group can automatically adjust the number of instances based on historical data and predicted usage patterns, ensuring that the application has sufficient resources to handle the morning rush hour traffic without any performance issues.

Dynamic scaling based on memory utilization (option B) may not be effective in this case as it would only respond to current usage patterns and not anticipate future demand. Launching new instances based on CPU utilization (option D) may also not be effective as the application may not be able to handle the increased capacity quickly enough during the morning rush hour. Scheduled scaling (option C) is not a suitable solution in this case as it would not take into account the dynamic nature of the workload.
