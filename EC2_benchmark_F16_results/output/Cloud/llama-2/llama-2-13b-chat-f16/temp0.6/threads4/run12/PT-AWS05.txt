A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

This option is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements because it allows for real-time tracking of changes made to items in DynamoDB, and automatically processes and saves those changes to the other table.

Option A is not suitable because DynamoDB Accelerator is a feature that optimizes data retrieval performance, but it does not provide real-time tracking or synchronization of data changes.

Option B is not suitable because Point-in-Time Recovery is a feature that allows for the recovery of DynamoDB tables to a specific point in time, but it does not provide real-time tracking or synchronization of data changes.

Option D is not suitable because DynamoDB Streams are a feature that provides real-time stream of data modifications, but it requires additional configuration and maintenance compared to using Amazon EventBridge.
