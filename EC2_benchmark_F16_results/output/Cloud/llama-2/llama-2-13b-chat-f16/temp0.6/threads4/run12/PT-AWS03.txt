A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:
Option A is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk as it utilizes AWS Config rules to detect and remediate any security groups that allow inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. By associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function, the remediation can be automated, reducing manual intervention and increasing efficiency. This approach also ensures that all security groups are updated with the corporate firewall IP address, providing a consistent and secure configuration across all EC2 instances.

The other options do not address the security risk as effectively:

Option B does not directly address the security risk, as it only sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances, which does not automatically remediate the security groups.

Option C blocks source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, but this approach may block legitimate traffic and does not provide a scalable solution for managing multiple security groups.

Option D does not address the security risk directly, as it only provides automated monitoring of security groups, without providing any remediation or mitigation capabilities.
