A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:

To ensure the sensitive PII data is protected, the Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption for the S3 bucket using a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach ensures that the master keys are never sent to AWS and only the encrypted data is stored in the S3 bucket. The client-side encryption will encrypt the data before it is sent to the S3 bucket, and the KMS-managed customer master key will be used to encrypt the data.

Option A is incorrect because it uses a client-side master key, which would not provide the necessary protection for sensitive data. Option C is incorrect because it uses a server-side encryption, which would require the master keys to be stored in AWS. Option D is incorrect because it allows the customer to provide their own key, which may not meet the company's compliance requirements.
