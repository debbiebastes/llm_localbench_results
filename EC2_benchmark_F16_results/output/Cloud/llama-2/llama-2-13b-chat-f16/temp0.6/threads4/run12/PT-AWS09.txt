A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:
API Gateway can help protect backend systems from traffic spikes by implementing throttling limits, which control the number of requests that can be made to a specific resource within a given time period. Result caching can also be enabled in API Gateway, allowing frequently requested data to be stored and served directly from the cache, rather than having to retrieve it from the backend every time.

Option A is not a good choice since EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling are not designed for handling traffic spikes. Option C is also not a good choice as CloudFront is a CDN but it doesn't have built-in throttling or caching capabilities. Option D is not relevant to the scenario.
