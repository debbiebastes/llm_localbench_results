The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:

In this scenario, the priority is to quickly mitigate security risks by deploying OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager is the best solution for this as it allows for easy deployment of patches across multiple instances at once. Additionally, setting up AWS Config will allow for tracking and recording of any configuration changes made during the patching process for audit purposes.

Option A is not suitable as it only provides a limited set of patches and does not offer centralized management of patches. Option B is also not suitable as it requires additional setup and does not offer real-time compliance tracking. Option D is not feasible as it would require manual intervention to install patches on a weekly basis, which is not a scalable or efficient solution.
