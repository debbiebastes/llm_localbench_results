Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed event bus that allows you to communicate between microservices, applications, and other AWS services. With EventBridge, you can create events from a wide range of sources such as API calls, changes to Amazon S3 buckets, or custom applications, and subscribe to these events to trigger actions in your application.

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) allows you to decouple components of your application by using queues for message passing. However, it is not an event-driven service like EventBridge.

Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a messaging service that sends messages or push notifications to multiple subscribers or clients. It is not designed for decoupling components of your application architecture.

Amazon Kinesis is a data streaming service that allows you to build real-time data pipelines, but it does not provide the same level of event-driven functionality as EventBridge.
