A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:
To comply with the requirements, you need to track new changes made to the items in DynamoDB and store them in another table in another region. Option C is the most ideal way to do this.

Option A is not relevant as it only provides a way to accelerate queries on DynamoDB, but does not help with tracking and storing new changes.

Option B is not necessary as Point-in-Time Recovery is used to restore the database to a specific point in time, not to track new changes.

Option D is also not relevant as DynamoDB Streams do not provide the ability to process and save new changes to another table.
