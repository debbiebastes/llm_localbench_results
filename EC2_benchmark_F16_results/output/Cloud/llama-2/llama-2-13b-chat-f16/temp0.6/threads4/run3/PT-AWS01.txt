A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Rationale:

To comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements, the Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption using a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach ensures that the master keys are not sent to AWS, as the encryption is performed on the client-side. The KMS-managed customer master key is securely stored on the client side and never exposed to AWS.

Option A is not suitable because it requires sending the master key to AWS, which violates the compliance requirements. Option C and D are also not applicable because they require storing the encryption keys on the server side, which increases the risk of unauthorized access.
