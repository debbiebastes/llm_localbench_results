Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(B) 12

Explanation: With six open shards and one worker per instance, each instance can process three shards. Therefore, to achieve optimum performance with the new number of shards, you need at least twice as many instances as you had before, which is 12 instances in this case.
