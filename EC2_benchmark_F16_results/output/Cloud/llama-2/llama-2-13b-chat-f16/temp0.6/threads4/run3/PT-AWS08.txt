An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

To meet the requirement for a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads, option B is the best choice. Attaching an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume to your EC2 instance provides a highly available and scalable block storage solution that can handle high-performance workloads.

Option A would not meet the requirement because instance store volumes are not designed for mission-critical workloads and do not provide the same level of durability and availability as EBS volumes.

Option C is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is an infrequently accessed (IA) storage class that is optimized for storage of data that is unlikely to be accessed frequently, such as backups or archives. It is not designed for mission-critical workloads that require high availability and performance.

Option D is incorrect because using an instance store volume would not provide the same level of durability and availability as an EBS volume. Instance store volumes are tied to the instance they are attached to and will be lost if the instance is terminated or stopped.
