I am extremely disappointed with this wardrobe. The quality of the materials used is very poor and the construction feels flimsy. The doors do not close properly and the hinges are already coming loose after just a few weeks of use. I expected much better for the price I paid. Would not recommend it.

I was very impressed with this toaster. The design is sleek and modern, and it looks great on my countertop. It's also incredibly easy to use - just pop in your toast and set the timer, and you're good to go! The toaster evenly toasts the bread, so there are no hot spots or uneven toasting. I appreciate the variety of browning options, which allows me to get my toast just right. Overall, I would highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a new toaster.
