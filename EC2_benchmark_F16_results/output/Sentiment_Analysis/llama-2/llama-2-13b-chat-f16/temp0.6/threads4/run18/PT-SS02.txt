Here is a product review from a customer, which is delimited with triple backticks.

Review text: 
```
The quality of the fabric on this couch is okay, but it's not the most comfortable seating I've experienced. It looks nice in my living room, though.
```

Overall sentiment must be one of the following options:
A) Positive
B) Negative
C) Neutral

What is the overall sentiment of that product review? 

Answer:
C) Neutral

The reviewer states the quality of the fabric is "okay" and that it's not the most comfortable seating they've experienced, which suggests a neutral sentiment. The fact that the couch looks nice in their living room is mentioned as well, but it doesn't outweigh the negative comments about the comfort level.
