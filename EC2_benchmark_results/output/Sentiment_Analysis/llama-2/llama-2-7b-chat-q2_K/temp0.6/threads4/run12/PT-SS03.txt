Review text: 
```
I am extremely disappointed with it. The quality of the product is very poor and does not meet my expectations at all. The materials used feel cheap and the vanity arrived with several scratches and dents. The assembly instructions were also confusing and the whole process took much longer than anticipated. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
