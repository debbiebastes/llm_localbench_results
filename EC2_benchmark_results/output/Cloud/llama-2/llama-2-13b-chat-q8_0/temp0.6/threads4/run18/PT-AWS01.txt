A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:

The best option for the security engineer to implement is (B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach ensures that the sensitive PII data is encrypted on the client-side using a Key Management Service (KMS)-managed master key, which is stored securely outside of AWS. This way, the unencrypted data and master keys are never sent to AWS, thus complying with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company.

Option A is not suitable as it would require the Security Engineer to manage the client-side master key, which may not be secure. Option C is not suitable as it would require the Security Engineer to manage the server-side encryption and decryption, which may also not be secure. Option D is not suitable as it would require the Security Engineer to provide the customer provided key, which may not be secure.
