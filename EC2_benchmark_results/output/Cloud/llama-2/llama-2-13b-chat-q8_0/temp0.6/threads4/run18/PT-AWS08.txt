An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Rationale:

* An EBS volume is a persistent block storage volume that can be attached to an EC2 instance. It provides a more durable storage solution compared to an instance store volume.
* Using Amazon S3 to store backup data provides a cost-effective and highly scalable storage solution.
* Configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days ensures that the backup data is stored in a more cost-effective storage class.

Option (A) is incorrect because an instance store volume is not a persistent block storage volume and is not suitable for mission-critical workloads.

Option (C) is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a storage class that provides long-term archiving, unlike Amazon S3 Glacier.

Option (D) is incorrect because an instance store volume is not a persistent block storage volume and is not suitable for mission-critical workloads.
