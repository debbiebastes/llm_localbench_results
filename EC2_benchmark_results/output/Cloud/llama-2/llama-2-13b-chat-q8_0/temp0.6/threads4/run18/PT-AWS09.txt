A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

Correct Answer: (B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation: When there is a sudden spike in traffic, it can overwhelm the backend systems and cause them to fail. To protect the backend systems from such traffic spikes, you can enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway. Throttling limits will help regulate the number of requests that can be made to the backend systems, while result caching will help reduce the load on the backend systems by storing frequently accessed data in memory.

Option (A) is not a good choice as it would require significant changes to the existing architecture and may not provide immediate relief from traffic spikes. Option (C) is also not relevant in this scenario as CloudFront is a content delivery network that can only cache static assets, not dynamic content generated by Lambda functions. Option (D) does not directly address the issue of traffic spikes.
