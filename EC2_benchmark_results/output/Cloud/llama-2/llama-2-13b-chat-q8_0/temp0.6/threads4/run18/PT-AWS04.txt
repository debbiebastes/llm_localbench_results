Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(B) 12

Explanation: The maximum number of EC2 instances that you can launch to achieve optimum performance is 12. This is because each instance can process one shard, and with six shards, you need six instances to process all the data in parallel. Launching more than 12 instances will not improve performance as there will be idle resources.

Note: The actual number of instances required may vary depending on the complexity of your application and the amount of data being processed. However, as a general rule of thumb, doubling the number of shards will approximately double the throughput of your application.
