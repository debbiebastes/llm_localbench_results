The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Rationale: The most suitable solution in this scenario is option C, which involves using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances and setting up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes. This approach allows for quick and easy deployment of patches, while also providing a centralized and auditable record of all changes made to the EC2 instances.

Option A is not suitable because it does not provide a centralized solution for deploying patches, and integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana may not be necessary for this scenario. Option B is also not suitable because AWS ES is not the best tool for recording and tracking configuration changes. Finally, option D is not suitable because it does not address the need for an audit trail of all changes made to the EC2 instances.
