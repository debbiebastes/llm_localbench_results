An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Option B is the correct answer because an EBS volume provides persistent block-level storage that meets the requirement of a mission-critical workload. Additionally, using Amazon S3 to store backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier will provide long-term archiving of the data after 30 days, which is required in the problem statement.

Option A is not suitable because instance stores are not designed for persistent block-level storage and may not meet the requirements of mission-critical workloads. Option C is also not suitable because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a highly durable and available object storage service, but it does not provide long-term archiving capabilities like Amazon S3 Glacier. Option D is not feasible because instance stores are not designed for persistent block-level storage and may not meet the requirements of mission-critical workloads.
