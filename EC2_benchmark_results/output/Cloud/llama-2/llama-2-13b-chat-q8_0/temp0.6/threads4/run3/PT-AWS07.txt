A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.

Explanation:

The issue of slow performance during the start of the day is likely due to the sudden increase in user traffic and demand for resources. Launching new instances based on memory utilization will ensure that the application has enough resources to handle the increased traffic and prevent slow performance. This approach allows the Auto Scaling group to automatically add new instances when memory utilization reaches a certain threshold, ensuring that the application has sufficient resources at all times.

Option A is not the most operationally efficient solution as it would require more advanced configuration and monitoring to accurately predict the scaling needs of the application. Option C would not be effective as it would launch new instances only once per day, regardless of actual usage. Option D would not address the issue of slow performance during the start of the day.
