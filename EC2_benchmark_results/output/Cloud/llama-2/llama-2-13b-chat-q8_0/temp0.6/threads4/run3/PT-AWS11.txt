Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).

Amazon EventBridge (previously known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed event bus that allows you to communicate between independent services or microservices in your application, enabling loosely coupled architectures.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queue service that enables you to decouple the components of your application by using messages queues, but it does not provide event-driven architecture capabilities like Amazon EventBridge.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a messaging service that sends notifications or messages to multiple subscribers or clients, but it is not designed for building event-driven applications.

Amazon Kinesis is a streaming data service that enables you to build real-time data processing applications, but it does not provide event-driven architecture capabilities like Amazon EventBridge.
