A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:
API Gateway can help protect backend systems from traffic spikes by enabling throttling limits and result caching. Throttling limits can be used to regulate the number of requests that are allowed to reach the backend, while result caching can help reduce the load on the backend by storing frequently accessed data in memory.

Option (A) is not a good choice because EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling may not provide the same level of scalability and high availability as API Gateway and Lambda. Option (C) may not be effective in reducing the load on the backend, as CloudFront is primarily designed for content delivery and caching. Option (D) does not address the issue of traffic spikes.
