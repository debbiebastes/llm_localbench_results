A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

* Option A, setting up DynamoDB Accelerator, is not relevant to complying with the requirements of recording new changes in another DynamoDB table in another region.
* Option B, enabling DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery, would allow for restoring a database to a previous state, but it would not record new changes made to the items in DynamoDB.
* Option D, enabling DynamoDB Streams, would provide real-time streaming of data changes, but it would require more setup and configuration than option C. Additionally, option D would require the Lambda function to continuously poll for new changes, while option C would use an event-driven approach.

Option C is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements because it allows for real-time processing of new changes made to items in DynamoDB, without requiring any additional setup or configuration beyond creating an Amazon EventBridge rule. The Lambda function can be set up as a target for the rule, which will process and save new changes to the other table. This approach is scalable, secure, and allows for real-time processing of data changes.
