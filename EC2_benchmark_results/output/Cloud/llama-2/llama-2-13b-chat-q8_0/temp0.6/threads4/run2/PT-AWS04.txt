Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

The optimal number of EC2 instances needed to process a Kinesis stream with six open shards would be 6. Each instance would run one KCL worker, processing one shard each, resulting in complete utilization of the available resources and optimum performance.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 6.
