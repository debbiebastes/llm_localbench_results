A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
A) Using AWS Config rules to automatically detect and remediate the security risk is the most efficient way to address this issue. This approach allows for real-time monitoring and automatic remediation of security groups that allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, ensuring compliance with corporate firewall policies. The use of Systems Manager Automation documents and AWS Lambda functions enables automated remediation, reducing manual effort and minimizing the risk of human error.

Rationale:

* Option A is more efficient than option B (setting up a Transit VPC) because it does not require additional infrastructure setup or configuration.
* Option C (blocking source IP addresses using Network ACL) may not be effective in this case, as it would block all traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, potentially impacting legitimate traffic.
* Option D (using AWS Shield) is not directly related to remediating the security risk and does not provide real-time monitoring or automatic remediation capabilities.
