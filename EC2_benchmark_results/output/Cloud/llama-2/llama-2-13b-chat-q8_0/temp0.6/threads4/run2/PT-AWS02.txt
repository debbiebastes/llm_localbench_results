The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:

In this scenario, the company needs to immediately mitigate security risks associated with outdated OS versions on their EC2 instances, while also maintaining audit records of all changes related to patching compliance statuses.

Option B provides a comprehensive solution for this requirement by leveraging AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager and Amazon ES for the following reasons:

1. AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager allows for easy deployment of OS patches across multiple EC2 instances, ensuring timely security updates are applied to mitigate potential risks.
2. By integrating with Amazon ES, all configuration changes related to patching can be recorded and tracked for audit purposes, providing a complete view of the company's compliance posture.
3. Amazon ES provides a scalable and highly available solution for log storage and analysis, allowing the IT Security team to efficiently monitor and investigate security-related events.

Therefore, option B is the most suitable solution in this scenario.
