A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:

The cost of using an On-Demand EC2 instance and migrating to a Reserved EC2 instance can be broken down into two parts: the upfront costs and the ongoing costs.

* Upfront Costs: The upfront costs for a Reserved Instance include the fee for the reserved instance and any applicable taxes.
* Ongoing Costs: The ongoing costs for a Reserved Instance include the hourly usage charges for the instance, as well as any additional costs for storage, databases, and other services used by the application.

In this scenario, we are looking to find the most cost-effective option for hosting the application over a period of more than 3 years.

Option (A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term has the highest upfront costs and is not the most cost-effective option for long-term usage.

Option (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term has the highest upfront costs and is not the most cost-effective option for long-term usage.

Option (D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year has the lowest upfront costs but would result in higher ongoing costs over a 3-year period due to the annual renewal fees.

Therefore, the most cost-effective option for hosting the application over a period of more than 3 years would be:

Option (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option has the lowest upfront costs and provides the best value for long-term usage, as it allows for flexibility in adjusting the instance type or location as needed without incurring any penalties.
