A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:

To comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company, it is important to implement encryption that never sends the master keys or unencrypted data to AWS. The solution that meets these requirements is option (B) - Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

In this approach, the Security Engineer will use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage the master key for encryption and decryption of the data stored in the S3 bucket. The KMS-managed customer master key is never sent to AWS, and instead, it is securely stored on the client-side. This ensures that the sensitive PII data is encrypted at the client-side before it is stored in the S3 bucket, and only the authorized users have access to the decryption keys.

Option (A) - Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key - does not meet the requirements as the master key would still need to be sent to AWS. Option (C) - Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key - would require sending the master key to AWS, which is not desirable. Option (D) - Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key - is not secure as it would be easy for an attacker to access the key and decrypt the data.
