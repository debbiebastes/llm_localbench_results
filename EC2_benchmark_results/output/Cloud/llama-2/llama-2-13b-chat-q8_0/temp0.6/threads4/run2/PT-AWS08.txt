An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Option B is the correct answer because EBS volumes are designed for persistent storage, whereas instance store volumes are intended for temporary storage. Additionally, using Amazon S3 for backup data provides scalability and durability, while configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days ensures long-term archiving of the data.

Option A is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads.

Option C is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a storage class that provides long-term archiving, and objects stored in this class will be subject to eventual deletion.

Option D is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads.
