An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B - Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Option B is the correct answer because it meets all the requirements listed above:

* Persistent block storage: EBS volumes provide persistent block-level storage that can be used for mission-critical workloads.
* Backup data in S3: S3 is a highly durable and scalable object store that can be used to store backup data.
* Lifecycle policy to transition objects to Glacier: A lifecycle policy can be configured to automatically move objects from S3 to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which meets the requirement of storing backup data in an object storage service and then transitioning it to a data archiving storage service.

Option A is not the correct answer because instance store volumes are not persistent and cannot be used for mission-critical workloads. Option C is not the correct answer because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a data archiving storage service. Option D is not the correct answer because instance store volumes are not persistent and cannot be used for mission-critical workloads.
