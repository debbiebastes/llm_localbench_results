A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C

Explanation:
Option C is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements. By creating an Amazon EventBridge rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, any new changes made to the items in DynamoDB will be captured and processed by the Lambda function. This approach allows for real-time processing of new changes without having to rely on periodic snapshots or other synchronization methods.

Option A is not ideal because it requires additional infrastructure (DynamoDB Accelerator) that may not be necessary in this scenario. Option B may not provide real-time synchronization and may require more configuration and maintenance. Option D may also not provide real-time synchronization and may require more complex setup and management of DynamoDB Streams.

Therefore, option C is the most ideal choice for complying with the requirements.
