A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

The most operationally efficient solution to ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day is to configure a Scheduled scaling policy (Option C).

Rationale:

* Predictive scaling (Option A) may not be effective in this scenario as it relies on historical data to predict future usage patterns, and the sudden increase in traffic at the start of the day may not be fully captured by the prediction.
* Dynamic scaling based on Memory utilization (Option B) may not be effective as memory usage is likely to be high during the startup period but will decrease as the application settles down.
* Dynamic scaling based on CPU utilization (Option D) may not be effective as CPU usage is unlikely to be high during the startup period.

By configuring a Scheduled scaling policy, you can specify the desired number of instances and the start time for the scaling event, ensuring that the application has enough resources available at the beginning of the day when traffic increases. This approach allows for more precise control over the scaling process and is more operationally efficient than the other options.
