A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

A) Using AWS Config rules to automatically detect and remediate security groups allowing inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is the most efficient way to mitigate this risk. This approach allows for automatic detection of the security group configurations, immediate remediation through associated Systems Manager Automation documents and AWS Lambda functions, and ensures that all instances are compliant with the corporate firewall policies.

Explanation:

Option A is the best choice for several reasons:

1. Automatic detection: AWS Config rules can automatically detect security groups that allow inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, eliminating the need for manual checks and reducing the risk of human error.
2. Immediate remediation: By associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule, any security groups that are found to be non-compliant can be automatically updated with the corporate firewall IP address, ensuring prompt remediation.
3. Scalability: This approach can be easily scaled to cover all security groups and instances in the account, providing comprehensive coverage and reducing the risk of security breaches.
4. Compliance: Using AWS Config rules and Systems Manager Automation documents ensures that all instances are compliant with the corporate firewall policies, reducing the risk of security breaches and improving overall security posture.

Option B (Setting up a Transit VPC) is not the most efficient solution as it requires additional setup and configuration, and may not provide immediate remediation for existing security groups. Option C (Blocking source IP addresses) may not be effective in this scenario as it would block all traffic from the specified CIDR range, potentially impacting legitimate traffic. Option D (Using AWS Shield) does not provide a direct solution for automatically detecting and remediating non-compliant security groups.
