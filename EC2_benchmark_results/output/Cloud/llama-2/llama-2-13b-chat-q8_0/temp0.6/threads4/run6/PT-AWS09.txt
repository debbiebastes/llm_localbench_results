A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:
API Gateway can help protect backend systems from traffic spikes by enabling throttling limits and result caching. Throttling limits can be used to limit the number of requests that can be made to the backend system within a certain time frame, preventing overloading and helping maintain system stability. Result caching can also be used to cache frequently requested data in API Gateway, reducing the number of requests sent to the backend system and improving response times.

Option A is not the best choice as it would require significant changes to the current architecture, and may not provide immediate relief from traffic spikes. Option C would not address the issue of traffic spikes directly. Option D would not have any direct impact on protecting backend systems from traffic spikes.
