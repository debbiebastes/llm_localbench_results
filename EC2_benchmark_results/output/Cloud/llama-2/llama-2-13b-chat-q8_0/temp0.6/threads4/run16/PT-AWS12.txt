A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:
The most cost-effective option would be option B, which offers the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO) over the 3-year period. The TCO is calculated by adding up the costs of the Reserved Instances for each year and comparing them to the On-Demand prices for each year.

Here's how the TCO breaks down:

Year 1:

* On-Demand price: $0.09/hour x 8,760 hours = $8,024
* Reserved Instance price (No Upfront): $0.05/hour x 8,760 hours = $4,380

Year 2:

* On-Demand price: $0.09/hour x 8,760 hours = $8,024
* Reserved Instance price (No Upfront): $0.05/hour x 8,760 hours = $4,380

Year 3:

* On-Demand price: $0.09/hour x 8,760 hours = $8,024
* Reserved Instance price (No Upfront): $0.05/hour x 8,760 hours = $4,380

Total cost over 3 years:

* On-Demand: $24,064
* Reserved Instance (No Upfront): $12,960

As you can see, the Reserved Instance option (B) results in a total cost savings of $11,104 over the 3-year period compared to the On-Demand option. This is because the Reserved Instance option allows you to lock in a lower hourly price for a longer period of time, which can help you save money in the long run.

So, if the application being hosted will be used for more than 3 years, the most cost-effective option would be to go with the No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term (option B).
