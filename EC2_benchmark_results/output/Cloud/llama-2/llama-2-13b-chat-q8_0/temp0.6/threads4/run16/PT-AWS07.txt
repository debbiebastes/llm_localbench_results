A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.

Explanation:
The issue is related to performance during the start of the day, which suggests that there might be a lack of resources (e.g., memory) to handle the increased traffic. Therefore, scaling based on memory utilization would be the most appropriate solution. Launching new instances based on memory utilization will ensure that the application has enough resources to handle the increased traffic at the start of the day.

Option A is not the best choice since predictive scaling is more appropriate for long-term capacity planning and may not address the immediate performance issues during the start of the day. Option C is also not the best choice since scheduled scaling may not be able to respond quickly enough to changes in traffic patterns. Option D is not the best choice since CPU utilization may not be the primary factor causing performance issues during the start of the day.
