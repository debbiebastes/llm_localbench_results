A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Rationale:

* Option A is not the best choice because DynamoDB Accelerator is meant for caching data, not for replicating data between tables.
* Option B requires manual intervention to trigger Point-in-Time Recovery, which may not be feasible in this scenario.
* Option D requires setting up and maintaining a separate stream, which may add complexity and cost to the solution.

By using Amazon EventBridge, you can set up a rule that triggers on table-level events in DynamoDB, such as new item creation or updates. This will allow you to capture all changes made to items in one table and write them to another table in near real-time, without the need for manual intervention or additional infrastructure. Additionally, EventBridge can handle scaling and reliability for you, so you don't have to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

Therefore, option C is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements.
