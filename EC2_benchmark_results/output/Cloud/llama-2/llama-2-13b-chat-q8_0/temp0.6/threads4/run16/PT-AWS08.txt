An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

The correct answer is (B). Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a block-level storage service that provides persistent storage for your EC2 instances. EBS volumes are ideal for mission-critical workloads and can be attached to multiple EC2 instances, making it easy to move your data between instances without having to worry about data loss.

Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides scalable and durable storage for your data. It's designed to store large amounts of data for long periods of time and can be used to store backups, archives, and other infrequently accessed data.

By attaching an EBS volume in your EC2 instance and using Amazon S3 to store your backup data, you'll have a persistent storage solution that can meet the needs of your mission-critical workloads. Additionally, by configuring a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, you'll be able to keep your data stored in S3 for long periods of time while minimizing your storage costs.

Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not persistent and cannot be used for mission-critical workloads. Option (C) is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a more expensive storage class that is not necessary for this use case. Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not persistent and cannot be used for mission-critical workloads.
