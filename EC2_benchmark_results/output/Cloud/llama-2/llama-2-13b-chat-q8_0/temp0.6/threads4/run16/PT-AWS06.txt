A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation: A 502 Bad Gateway error occurs when the server acting as a gateway to another server or application receives an invalid response from the upstream server. This indicates that the output returned by the Lambda function is incompatible with the API Gateway's expectations, causing the request to fail. Since the developer was able to successfully invoke the underlying function and receive the result in XML format, it suggests that the issue is related to the integration between the Lambda function and the API Gateway. Therefore, option (A) is the most likely root cause of the problem.
