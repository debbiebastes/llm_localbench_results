The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Rationale:

Option (C) is the best solution in this scenario because it allows the IT Security team to quickly and easily deploy OS patches to the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager. Additionally, setting up AWS Config will provide a centralized and automated way to record and track any configuration changes made to the instances, which is essential for audit purposes.

Option (A) does not fully address the need for recording and tracking configuration changes, as it only provides integration with Kibana. Option (B) does not provide a solution for recording and tracking configuration changes. Option (D) does not provide a centralized and automated way to deploy OS patches, and instead relies on manual intervention to install patches on a weekly basis.
