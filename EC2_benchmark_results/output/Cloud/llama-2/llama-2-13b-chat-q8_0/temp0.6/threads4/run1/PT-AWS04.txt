Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(B) 12

Rationale:
When resharding your Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards should be a multiple of the number of worker instances. To achieve optimum performance, you should launch twice the number of EC2 instances as the number of open shards. In this case, with six open shards, you should launch 12 EC2 instances.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 12.
