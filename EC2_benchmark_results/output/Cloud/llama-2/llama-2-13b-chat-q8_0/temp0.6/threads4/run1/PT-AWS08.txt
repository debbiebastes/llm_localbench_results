An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:
EBS (Elastic Block Store) is a persistent block storage volume that can be attached to an existing EC2 instance, providing the necessary persistent storage for mission-critical workloads. Amazon S3 is object storage service that provides scalable and durable storage for backups. By attaching an EBS volume and using Amazon S3 for backup data, you can meet the requirement of a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, while also taking advantage of the scalability and durability of object storage for backup data.

Option A is incorrect because instance store volumes are temporary storage volumes that are stored in the instance's memory, making them unsuitable for mission-critical workloads. Option C is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a storage class that provides infrequently accessed storage at a lower cost than standard Amazon S3, but it does not provide the same level of durability as Amazon S3 Glacier. Option D is incorrect because instance store volumes are temporary storage volumes that are stored in the instance's memory, making them unsuitable for mission-critical workloads.

Therefore, option B is the best answer.
