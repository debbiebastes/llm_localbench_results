A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 

C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Rationale: EventBridge is a fully managed service that provides real-time event processing, allowing you to subscribe to events from various AWS services, including DynamoDB. By creating a rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, you can automatically process and save new changes to the other table without having to modify your application code or set up a separate data pipeline.

Option A is not the most ideal solution because DynamoDB Accelerator only improves performance for certain types of read and write operations, but it does not provide real-time event processing. Option D is also not the best choice because DynamoDB Streams requires manual configuration and can be more complex to set up and maintain than EventBridge.
