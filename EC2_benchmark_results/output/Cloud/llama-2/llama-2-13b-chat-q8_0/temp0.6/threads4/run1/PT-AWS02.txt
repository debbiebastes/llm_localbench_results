The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the most suitable solution is option C, which involves using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances, and setting up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes. This approach provides a comprehensive solution for mitigating security risks, as well as maintaining compliance with audit requirements.

AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager allows for automated patch deployment, which helps to quickly address the vulnerability in the old operating systems of the EC2 instances. Additionally, AWS Config provides a centralized view of configuration changes and allows for automated tracking and reporting of compliance statuses. This integrated approach ensures that all changes are recorded and tracked, providing an auditable record of the patch deployment process.

Option A is not the best solution as it does not provide a comprehensive patch management solution, and integration with Kibana may not be necessary for this scenario. Option B is also not the best solution as it does not provide automated patch deployment or configuration tracking features. Option D is not a suitable solution as it does not address the security risk and compliance requirements of the scenario.
