Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

B) 12

Explanation: 

The maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimal performance is 12. This is because each instance can process one shard, and with six shards, you need six instances to fully utilize the capacity of your Kinesis stream. Additionally, having more instances will provide fault tolerance and improve the overall processing performance of your application.
