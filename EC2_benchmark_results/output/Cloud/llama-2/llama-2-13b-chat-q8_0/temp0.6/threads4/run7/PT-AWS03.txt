A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is option (A) Using AWS Config rules to automatically detect, associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

This option allows for the automated detection of security groups that allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, followed by remediation through a Systems Manager Automation document associated with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule. This approach is efficient as it leverages existing AWS services and eliminates manual effort to remediate the security risk.

Option (B) Setting up a transit VPC does not directly address the security risk, and option (C) Blocking the source IP addresses using Network ACLs may not be practical, especially if there are legitimate traffic sources from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Option (D) Using AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups is also not a direct remediation method.
