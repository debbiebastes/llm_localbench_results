A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 

C

Explanation: 

Option C is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements. Creating an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB and setting a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table allows for real-time replication of new changes from one DynamoDB table to another without the need for manual intervention or complex infrastructure setup like DynamoDB Accelerator.

Option D, enabling DynamoDB Streams, would also achieve the same goal but requires more infrastructure setup and ongoing management compared to Option C.

Option A is not relevant in this scenario as DynamoDB Accelerator is not necessary for replicating changes from one DynamoDB table to another.

Option B, enabling Point-in-Time Recovery, would allow for restoring the database to a specific point in time but would not replicate new changes in real-time to another table.
