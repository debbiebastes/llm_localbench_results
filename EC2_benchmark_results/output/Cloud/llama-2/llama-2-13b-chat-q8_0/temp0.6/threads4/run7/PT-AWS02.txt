The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is option (C): Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:

AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides a centralized way to manage patches and software updates for EC2 instances, making it the most suitable solution for quickly deploying OS patches to address the security risk. Additionally, by integrating with AWS Config, all configuration changes can be recorded and tracked for audit purposes. This approach allows for efficient patch management while also ensuring compliance with security standards.

Option (A) is not a suitable solution as it does not provide a centralized way to manage patches and software updates. Option (B) is not a suitable solution as it does not integrate with AWS Config for recording and tracking configuration changes. Option (D) is not a suitable solution as it does not address the security risk by deploying OS patches immediately.
