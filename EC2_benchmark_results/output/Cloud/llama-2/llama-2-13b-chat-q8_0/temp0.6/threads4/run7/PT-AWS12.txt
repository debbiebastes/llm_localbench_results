A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:
The most cost-effective option for the company would be to go with (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option offers the lowest total cost of ownership as there is no upfront payment required, and the instance can be converted to other reserved instances or on-demand instances as needed. Additionally, this option provides more flexibility in case the company decides to scale up or down during the 3-year term.

Note: The assumption here is that the application being hosted will be used for more than 3 years, which makes the upfront payment for (A) and (C) not worth it.
