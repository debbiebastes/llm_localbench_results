An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B: Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation: 

To meet the requirement of persistent block storage, you should use an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume instead of an instance store volume. EBS volumes are designed for persistent storage and can be attached to multiple instances, making them ideal for mission-critical workloads.

Option B is the correct answer because it suggests attaching an EBS volume and using Amazon S3 to store backup data. Additionally, configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier will help reduce storage costs by moving infrequently accessed data to a more cost-effective storage class.

The other options are not the best fit for this requirement:

A: Attaching an instance store volume is not recommended for persistent block storage, as it is designed for temporary storage and is not suitable for mission-critical workloads.

C: Attaching an EBS volume and using Amazon S3 to store backup data is a valid approach, but configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA may not be the most cost-effective solution, as it will result in higher storage costs compared to Amazon S3 Glacier.

D: Attaching an instance store volume is not recommended for persistent block storage, as it is designed for temporary storage and is not suitable for mission-critical workloads.
