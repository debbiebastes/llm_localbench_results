A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:

In this scenario, the Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key to ensure that the sensitive PII data is encrypted on the client-side and never sent to AWS in plaintext. This approach complies with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company as the master keys are not stored or managed by AWS.

Option (A) is incorrect because it would require the Security Engineer to manage the client-side encryption keys, which may not be feasible or secure. Option (C) is also incorrect because it would require the Security Engineer to manage the server-side encryption keys, which is not recommended as it can increase the risk of data breaches. Option (D) is incorrect because it would allow the Security Engineer to use a customer-provided key, but this may not meet compliance requirements if the customer does not have proper security controls in place.
