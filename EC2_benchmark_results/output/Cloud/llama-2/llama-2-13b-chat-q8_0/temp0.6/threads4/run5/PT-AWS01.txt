A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.  

Explanation: 
To comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company, the security engineer should implement client-side encryption using a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach ensures that the master keys are never sent to AWS, as they are stored on the client side and only used to encrypt the data. Additionally, using a KMS-managed key provides an additional layer of security and compliance, as it is managed by AWS and meets the necessary regulatory requirements.

Option (A) is incorrect because it uses a client-side master key, which may not meet the regulatory requirements.

Option (C) is incorrect because it uses a server-side encryption, which may not provide the necessary security controls for sensitive PII data.

Option (D) is incorrect because it uses a customer provided key, which may not be secure and may violate regulatory requirements.
