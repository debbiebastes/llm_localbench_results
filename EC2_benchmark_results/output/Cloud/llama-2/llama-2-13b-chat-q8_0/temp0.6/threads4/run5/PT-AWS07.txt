A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
B) Configure a dynamic scaling policy for the auto-scaling group to launch new instances based on memory utilization.

Explanation:

The issue is likely due to insufficient resources, specifically memory, during the start of the day when usage peaks. Launching more instances beforehand would help address this issue. A dynamic scaling policy based on memory utilization would allow for additional instances to be launched when memory usage exceeds a certain threshold, ensuring that the application can handle the increased load at the beginning of the day.

Option (A) is not the most operationally efficient solution as it would require more complex configuration and management of predictive scaling policies.

Option (C) is not appropriate as scheduling new instances beforehand may not address the immediate need for additional resources during peak usage hours.

Option (D) is not relevant to the issue at hand, as CPU utilization is not likely to be a significant factor in this scenario.
