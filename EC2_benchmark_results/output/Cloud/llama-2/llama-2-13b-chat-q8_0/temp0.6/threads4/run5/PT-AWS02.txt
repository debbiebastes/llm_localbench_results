The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:

In this scenario, the IT Security team needs to mitigate a security risk by deploying patches for outdated operating systems on EC2 instances. To do this, they need a solution that can easily deploy patches, track compliance, and provide detailed reporting.

Option C provides the most suitable solution:

1. AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager allows the team to easily deploy patches for the outdated EC2 instances, ensuring that all instances are updated with the latest security patches.
2. Setting up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes provides detailed reporting on compliance status, allowing the team to monitor the effectiveness of their mitigation efforts.
3. Integrating AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager with AWS Config provides a centralized solution for managing patching and compliance across all EC2 instances.

Option A is not suitable because it does not provide a comprehensive solution for tracking compliance status, and Option B is not necessary as AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager already includes Amazon ES for reporting. Option D is not a feasible solution as it cannot guarantee that all instances are updated with the latest security patches.
