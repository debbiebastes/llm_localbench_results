A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:

Enabling throttling limits in API Gateway will help control the number of requests that can be made to the Lambda function, preventing overloading and potential crashes. Additionally, enabling result caching in API Gateway will allow frequently requested data to be stored locally and returned directly from the cache without hitting the Lambda function again, reducing the load on the backend systems.

AWS Lambda and API Gateway are designed to handle sudden traffic spikes and can automatically scale up to meet demand, so there is no need to switch to a more scalable architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling. CloudFront in front of API Gateway would not provide any additional benefit in this scenario as it only caches static assets and not dynamic content from API Gateway.

Moving the Lambda function into a VPC would also not be necessary as API Gateway can handle traffic spikes without issue.
