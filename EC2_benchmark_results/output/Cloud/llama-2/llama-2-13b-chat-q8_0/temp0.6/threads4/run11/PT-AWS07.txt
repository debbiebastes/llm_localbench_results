A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation:

The problem described is a classic example of "ramp-up" or "start-of-day" scaling, where the application experiences a sudden surge in usage at the beginning of the day. To address this issue, we need to launch additional instances before the start of the day to handle the expected increase in traffic.

Option C is the most operationally efficient solution because it allows us to launch new instances according to a schedule, rather than based on real-time metrics like CPU or memory utilization. This approach ensures that the additional instances are available and ready to handle the increased traffic as soon as the day starts.

Option A (Predictive scaling) may not be effective in this case because it relies on historical data to predict future usage patterns, which may not accurately reflect the actual usage at the start of the day. Option B (Dynamic scaling based on memory utilization) and Option D (Dynamic scaling based on CPU utilization) are not optimal solutions because they would result in additional instances being launched only when the existing instances are already under heavy load, rather than before the start of the day.
