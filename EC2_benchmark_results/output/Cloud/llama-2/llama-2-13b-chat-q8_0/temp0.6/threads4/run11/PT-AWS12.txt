A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.	

Explanation:
The most cost-effective option would be (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option offers the lowest total cost of ownership as it eliminates upfront costs and provides a discounted hourly rate for the entire 3-year term.

Option (A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term is more expensive than Option (B) and does not provide any cost benefits for a 3-year commitment.

Option (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term has the highest upfront costs and may not be the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted is only expected to be used for more than 3 years.

Option (D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year is not a good long-term value as it does not provide any discounts for committing to a longer term and would result in higher total costs over 3 years.
