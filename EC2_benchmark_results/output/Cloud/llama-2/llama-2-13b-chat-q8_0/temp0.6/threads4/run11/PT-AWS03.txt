A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:

Option (A) is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk as it uses AWS Config rules to detect and remediate the security groups that allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range without any manual intervention. The use of Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule allows for automatic updates of the security group with the corporate firewall IP address, thereby mitigating the risk.

Option (B) setting up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances is not directly related to remediating the security risk.

Option (C) blocking the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL may help, but it does not address the root cause of the issue, which is the lack of approval for adding rules to security groups.

Option (D) using AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range may provide some monitoring benefits, but it does not provide a solution to remediate the security risk.
