Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

B) 12

Explanation:

Since each KCL worker can process one shard, and you have six open shards after resharding, you need at least six KCL workers to fully utilize the available processing capacity. Therefore, option B (12 EC2 instances) is the correct answer.

Note that launching more than 12 instances may not provide any additional performance benefits since each instance can only process one shard.
