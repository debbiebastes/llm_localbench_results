A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 

Explanation:
Client-side encryption is a technique where data is encrypted on the client-side before being sent to AWS, which ensures that the sensitive information is never exposed to AWS servers. By using a KMS-managed customer master key, the security engineer can ensure that the encryption and decryption of the data are done securely and compliant with the company's regulatory requirements.

Option (A) would not provide the necessary level of security as it uses a client-side master key, which could be compromised if the client is breached. Option (C) and (D) do not meet the requirement of never sending the sensitive information to AWS.
