The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:

In this scenario, the goal is to quickly mitigate the security risk by deploying patches to the outdated EC2 instances while also recording and tracking the changes for audit purposes. The best solution would be to use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems.

Option (C) is the most suitable solution because it allows for easy deployment of patches, as well as integration with AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes. This provides a complete audit trail of all changes made to the EC2 instances, which is essential for compliance purposes.

Option (A) does not provide a comprehensive solution for recording and tracking configuration changes, while Option (B) does not offer ease of deployment for patches. Option (D) is not a suitable solution as it would not provide the necessary audit trail of changes.
