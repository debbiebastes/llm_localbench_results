A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:
When there is an unexpected surge in traffic, it can be challenging to handle the sudden increase in requests. To mitigate this issue, we can use AWS API Gateway's built-in features such as throttling and caching to protect the backend systems from traffic spikes.
Throttling limits can be set up in API Gateway to limit the number of requests that can be made within a specific time frame. This helps prevent overloading the backend systems with too many requests at once. 
Result caching can also be enabled to cache the responses from the Lambda function, which can reduce the load on the backend system and improve response times. 

Option (A) is not the best choice as it involves changing the entire architecture of the platform, which may not be feasible or practical in this scenario. Option (C) does not address the issue of traffic spikes and is primarily used for content delivery networks. Option (D) does not provide any direct benefits in terms of handling traffic spikes.
