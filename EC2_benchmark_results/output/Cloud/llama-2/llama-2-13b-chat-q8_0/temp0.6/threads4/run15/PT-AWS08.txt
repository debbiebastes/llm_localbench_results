An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Option (A) is not suitable because instance store volumes are temporary and will be lost when the instance is terminated or stopped. Option (C) is not suitable because One Zone-IA is not designed for long-term storage, and objects in One Zone-IA will be transitioned to the standard Amazon S3 storage class after 30 days.

Option (B) is the best choice because EBS volumes are persistent and can be attached to multiple instances, making them suitable for mission-critical workloads. Additionally, you can use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which meets the requirement of storing the backup data in an object storage service and transitioning it to a long-term storage service after 30 days.
