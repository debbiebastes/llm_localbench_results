A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
(A) Using AWS Config rules to automatically detect and remediate security groups allowing inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is the most efficient way to automate this process.

Explanation:

Option (A) is the best choice for several reasons:

1. Automation: AWS Config rules can automatically detect and remediate security groups allowing inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which saves time and reduces the risk of human error.
2. Scalability: This approach can be easily scaled to cover multiple security groups and EC2 instances, making it a more efficient solution than manual remediation.
3. Integration: By associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule, the solution is tightly integrated with other AWS services, such as Systems Manager and Lambda.
4. Flexibility: This approach allows for customization of the remediation process, such as adding or removing IP addresses from the allow list, which is not possible with options (B), (C), or (D).

Option (B) setting up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances is not the most efficient approach as it requires additional infrastructure setup and maintenance.

Option (C) blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL is not a scalable solution as it would require manual configuration of each network ACL for every security group.

Option (D) using AWS Shield to monitor and detect all security groups allowing traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is not an automated solution, and requires additional cost and setup for AWS Shield.
