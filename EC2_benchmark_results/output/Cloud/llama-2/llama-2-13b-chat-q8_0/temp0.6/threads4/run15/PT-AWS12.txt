A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:
The correct answer is (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term, as it offers the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted will be used for more than 3 years. This pricing model allows you to pay for the reserved instance over the course of 3 years without any upfront costs, which can help reduce the total cost of ownership compared to other pricing models.

Here's a breakdown of the cost-effectiveness of each pricing model:

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term: This pricing model requires an upfront payment for the entire year, which can be a significant expense. If the application is only used for 3 years, this pricing model may not be the most cost-effective option.

(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term: This pricing model also requires an upfront payment for the entire 3-year period, which can be expensive. Additionally, this pricing model does not offer the same flexibility as the convertible reserved instance pricing model.

(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year: This pricing model may seem more cost-effective at first because there is no upfront payment required. However, the total cost of ownership over 3 years can be higher compared to the convertible reserved instance pricing model, as you will be paying for the reserved instance on a monthly basis for 3 years.

Therefore, if the application being hosted will be used for more than 3 years, the most cost-effective option is (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term, as it offers the flexibility of paying over time while still providing cost savings compared to other pricing models.
