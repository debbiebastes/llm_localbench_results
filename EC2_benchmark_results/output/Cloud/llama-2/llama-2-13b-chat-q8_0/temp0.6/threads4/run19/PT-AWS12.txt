A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:
The cost savings from using Reserved Instances are maximized when the usage of the instance is consistent over time, and when you commit to using the instance for a longer period of time. In this case, since the application will be used for more than 3 years, the best option would be to go with the No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option offers the lowest effective hourly price and provides the flexibility to change instance types or modify the usage of the instances within the reserved instance period without any penalties.

Option A, All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term, would require a significant upfront payment but would only provide cost savings for one year. Option C, All Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term, would also require a significant upfront payment and would lock the customer into a specific instance type for three years, which may not be flexible enough for their needs. Option D, No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year, would provide cost savings over time but would require annual payments and may not offer the same level of cost savings as the other options.
