An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
B. Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation: An Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume is a good choice for persistent block storage, as it provides persistent storage that is independent of the life of an EC2 instance. To meet the requirement of storing backup data in an object storage service and transitioning objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, you should choose option B.

Option A is incorrect because an instance store volume is not suitable for persistent block storage. Option C is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a data archiving service. Option D is incorrect because it does not provide a solution for storing backup data in an object storage service.
