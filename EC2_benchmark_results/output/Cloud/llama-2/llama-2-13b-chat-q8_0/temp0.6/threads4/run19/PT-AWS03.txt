A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:

Option (A) is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk because it uses AWS Config rules to detect any security groups that allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range and update them with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is automated, scalable, and can be integrated with other AWS services such as Systems Manager Automation documents and AWS Lambda functions.

Option (B) setting up a Transit VPC is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because it requires additional infrastructure setup and configuration.

Option (C) blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because it may block legitimate traffic as well.

Option (D) using AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because it only provides monitoring and detection capabilities and does not provide automatic remediation.
