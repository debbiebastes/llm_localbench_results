A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

Option C is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements because it allows for real-time processing of new changes made to items in DynamoDB, without the need for DynamoDB Accelerator or Point-in-Time Recovery.

Using Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) and a Lambda function as a rule target allows for the following:

1. Real-time processing of new changes: With EventBridge, you can set up a rule that triggers whenever there is an update to items in DynamoDB, allowing for real-time processing of new changes.
2. Customization: You can customize the rule to only trigger on specific types of updates or changes, giving you fine-grained control over what data is being processed.
3. Scalability: Lambda functions can scale automatically to handle large volumes of data, ensuring that your application can handle high traffic and large datasets without issues.
4. Cost-effective: With EventBridge, you only pay for the events that trigger your Lambda function, making it a cost-effective solution compared to other options like DynamoDB Accelerator or Point-in-Time Recovery.

Option D, enabling DynamoDB Streams, would also work, but it would require more setup and configuration compared to Option C. Additionally, with Option D, you would need to handle the data processing yourself, whereas with Option C, the Lambda function is triggered automatically by EventBridge.
