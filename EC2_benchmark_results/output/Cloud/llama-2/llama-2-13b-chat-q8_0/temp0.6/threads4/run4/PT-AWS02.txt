The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Rationale:
Option C is the most suitable solution in this scenario because it provides a comprehensive approach to addressing the security risk associated with outdated operating systems.

AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager can be used to easily deploy OS patches for the EC2 instances, ensuring that all instances are up-to-date and protected against known vulnerabilities. Additionally, AWS Config can be used to record and track any configuration changes, providing an audit trail of all changes made to the instances.

Option A is not suitable because it does not address the issue of outdated operating systems directly, and instead relies on AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager to deploy patches. Option B is not suitable because it uses Amazon ES to record and track configuration changes, which is not a comprehensive solution for auditing purposes. Option D is not suitable because it does not provide a comprehensive approach to addressing the security risk, instead relying on automatic installation of OS patches on a weekly basis.

Therefore, option C provides the most comprehensive and effective solution for mitigating the security risk associated with outdated operating systems on EC2 instances while also providing an audit trail of all changes made to the instances.
