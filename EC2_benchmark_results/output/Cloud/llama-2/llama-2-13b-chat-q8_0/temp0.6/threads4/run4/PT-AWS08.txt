An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

* An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume provides persistent storage for an EC2 instance, which meets the requirement of a persistent block storage volume.
* Using Amazon S3 to store backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier will provide a cost-effective and durable solution for long-term backup storage.
* Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads and do not provide the same level of persistence as EBS volumes.
* Option (C) is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a storage class that provides infrequent access to data, but it is not designed for long-term backup storage like Amazon S3 Glacier.
* Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads and do not provide the same level of persistence as EBS volumes.
