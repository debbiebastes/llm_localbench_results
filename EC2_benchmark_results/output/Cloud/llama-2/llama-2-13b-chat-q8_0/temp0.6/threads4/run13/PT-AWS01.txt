A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the Security Engineer should use a KMS-managed customer master key to encrypt the sensitive PII data before uploading it to the S3 bucket. This approach ensures that the master keys are never sent to AWS, and only authorized users have access to the encrypted data.

Option A is not suitable because client-side encryption would require the sensitive data to be decrypted on the client-side, which could increase the risk of data breaches.

Option C is not suitable because server-side encryption would not provide the required level of control over the encryption keys.

Option D is not suitable because customer-provided keys may not meet the regulatory and compliance requirements of the company.
