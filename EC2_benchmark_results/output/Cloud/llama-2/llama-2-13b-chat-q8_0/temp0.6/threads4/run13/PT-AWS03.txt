A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and remediate the security risk by associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule.

Explanation:

Option A is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk because it uses AWS Config rules to detect the security groups that allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and then remediates the issue by updating the security group with the corporate firewall IP address using a Systems Manager Automation document associated with an AWS Lambda function. This approach is efficient because it automates the detection and remediation process, reducing the need for manual intervention and minimizing the risk of human error.

Option B is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because setting up a Transit VPC would require additional infrastructure setup and configuration, which could be time-consuming and costly.

Option C is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using a Network ACL would only restrict traffic from unknown sources, and would not update the existing security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Option D is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because AWS Shield is a security service that provides automated detection and protection against DDoS attacks, and it may not be able to detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Additionally, AWS Shield may not have the capability to remediate the issue by updating the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
