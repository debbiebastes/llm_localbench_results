The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Rationale: In this scenario, the IT Security team needs to quickly mitigate security risks and ensure compliance with audit requirements by deploying OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. The best solution is to use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the patches, as it provides a centralized and automated way to manage patches across multiple instances. Additionally, setting up AWS Config will allow the team to record and track any configuration changes, providing an audit trail for compliance purposes.

Option A is not suitable because it does not provide a centralized solution for deploying patches and would require manual intervention to integrate with Kibana. Option B is also not suitable as it does not provide the necessary centralized management and automation features. Option D is not relevant as it does not address the security risk or compliance requirements.
