An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:
Option B is the best answer as it meets all the requirements mentioned above. An EBS volume provides persistent block storage, which is suitable for mission-critical workloads. Additionally, using Amazon S3 to store backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy will help in achieving the requirement of storing the backup data for 30 days and then transitioning it to a data archiving storage service.

Option A is not suitable as instance store volumes are temporary storage and are not suitable for mission-critical workloads. Option C is not suitable as Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a data archiving storage service. Option D is not suitable as the backup data will not be stored in an object storage service.
