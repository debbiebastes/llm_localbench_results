(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:

The most cost-effective option would be to go with the No Upfront, Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option offers the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO) as it eliminates the upfront payment and allows you to pay only for the actual usage of the instance over the 3-year term.

Here's a breakdown of the costs for each option:

Option A: All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term
Total Cost: $12,000 (upfront payment) + $4,800 (annual usage) = $16,800

Option B: No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term
Total Cost: $4,800 (annual usage x 3 years) = $14,400

Option C: All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term
Total Cost: $12,000 (upfront payment) + $4,800 (annual usage x 3 years) = $20,800

Option D: No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year
Total Cost: $4,800 (annual usage x 3 years) + $4,800 (renewal fee) = $19,200

As you can see, Option B (No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term) offers the lowest TCO of $14,400, which is significantly lower than the other options. This option also provides the flexibility to convert the instance to a different type or size if needed, without any upfront penalty. Therefore, this is the most cost-effective option for the company's needs.
