An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
B

Explanation: 
EC2 instances can only use EBS volumes, not instance store volumes, for persistent storage. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. Additionally, using an EBS volume provides a more cost-effective solution than an instance store volume, as EBS volumes are charged based on usage and instance store volumes are charged by the hour.

Option A is incorrect because instance store volumes are not designed for persistent storage and cannot be used for mission-critical workloads. Option C is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a storage class that provides infrequently accessed data, not a lifecycle policy that can transition objects to Glacier. Option D is incorrect because instance store volumes are not designed for persistent storage and cannot be used for mission-critical workloads.
