A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:

API Gateway provides built-in features such as throttling, caching, and request/response buffering that can help protect the backend systems from traffic spikes. By enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway, you can control the number of requests that are allowed to reach the backend systems, and cache the results of frequently requested APIs to reduce the load on the backend systems.

Option (A) is not a good choice as it would require significant changes to the existing architecture, and may not be able to handle sudden traffic spikes as efficiently as API Gateway.

Option (C) would only provide caching, but not throttling or request/response buffering.

Option (D) does not address the issue of traffic spikes on the backend systems.
