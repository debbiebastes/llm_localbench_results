Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12

Explanation:
To achieve the maximum throughput, we need to assign one EC2 instance per shard. Since there are six open shards now, we should launch 6 EC2 instances. However, since KCL workers can handle multiple shards, we can launch 12 EC2 instances, which is the maximum number possible in this case.

Note that the actual number of EC2 instances you might need depends on factors such as the volume of data, the complexity of your application's logic, and the resources available on each instance. This question only provides a general guideline for scaling up processing performance.
