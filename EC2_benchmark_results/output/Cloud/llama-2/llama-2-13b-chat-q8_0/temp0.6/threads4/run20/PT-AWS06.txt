A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation:

When a Lambda function returns an output that is not in the expected format, it can cause issues with the Amazon API Gateway proxy integration. In this case, the developer mentioned that the underlying function properly returned the result in XML format, but the API Gateway is still returning a 502 Bad Gateway error. This suggests that there is an issue with the output of the Lambda function being passed to the API Gateway.

Option (B) Endpoint request timed-out is not relevant, as the developer did not mention any issues with the latency or performance of the API.

Option (C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads is also unlikely, as the developer mentioned that the function properly returned the result in XML format.

Option (D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid is not relevant, as the developer did not mention any issues with the API name.
