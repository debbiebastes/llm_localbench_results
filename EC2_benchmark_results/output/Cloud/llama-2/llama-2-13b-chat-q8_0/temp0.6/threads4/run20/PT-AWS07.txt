A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation: The issue is that the application performance is slow during the start of the day, which means that the demand for resources (such as CPU and Memory) is high during this time. By configuring a Scheduled scaling policy, the Auto Scaling group will launch new instances before the start of the day to ensure that there are enough resources available to handle the increased demand. This will help to prevent performance issues and ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day.

Note: The other options do not address the issue as they either focus on adjusting the number of instances based on utilization (Option A and D) or launching new instances based on memory utilization (Option B).
