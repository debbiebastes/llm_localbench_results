A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:
To comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements, the Security Engineer should implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach allows the hospital to manage its own master keys in its on-premises key management system, while still using AWS KMS to encrypt and decrypt the data stored in the S3 bucket.

Client-side encryption ensures that sensitive PII of patients is encrypted before it leaves the hospital's network, which prevents unauthorized access to the data during transit or storage. By using a KMS-managed customer master key, the hospital can maintain control over the encryption and decryption process, while leveraging the scalability and reliability of AWS S3 for storing and retrieving the encrypted data.

The other options are not suitable for this scenario:

A) Implementing an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key would require the hospital to manage its own master keys, which is not recommended for sensitive PII data.

C) Implementing an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key would require the hospital to trust AWS to manage the encryption and decryption process, which may not be acceptable given the strict compliance requirements.

D) Implementing an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key would not provide adequate security controls for sensitive PII data, as the hospital would need to securely store and manage the encryption keys.
