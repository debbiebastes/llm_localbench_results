A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:

Option (A) allows for automatic detection and remediation of security groups that allow traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which is the most efficient way to address the security risk. By using AWS Config rules, you can automatically detect any security groups that allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range and remediate them by updating the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Option (B) setting up a Transit VPC does not directly address the security risk, as it only provides a way to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances.

Option (C) blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACLs may block legitimate traffic, and is not a scalable solution.

Option (D) using AWS Shield to monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is not an efficient way to remediate the security risk, as it only provides monitoring and detection capabilities, but does not provide a way to automatically remediate the issue.
