A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:

In this scenario, the Security Engineer should implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key to ensure that the sensitive PII data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. By using a KMS-managed customer master key, the Security Engineer can maintain control of the encryption keys and ensure that they are never sent to AWS.

Option A is not suitable because it requires the client-side master key to be stored on the client-side, which may not be secure. Option C is not suitable because it requires the server-side encryption, which may not be necessary in this scenario. Option D is not suitable because it requires the customer to provide the encryption key, which may not be feasible or secure.

Therefore, option B is the best choice for implementing client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key, which will ensure the security and compliance of the sensitive PII data stored in the Amazon S3 bucket.
