An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

The correct answer is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:
An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume provides persistent block-level storage for your EC2 instance, which meets the requirement of a persistent storage volume. Attaching an EBS volume to your EC2 instance will provide you with enough storage space to store your backup data.

Using Amazon S3 to store your backup data is a good choice because it is designed for storing large amounts of data and provides a highly durable and available storage solution. You can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which will help you reduce storage costs by moving infrequently accessed data to a more cost-effective storage class.

Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are designed for temporary storage and are not suitable for mission-critical workloads. Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a storage class that provides long-term archival storage, and it may not be suitable for your backup data. Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are designed for temporary storage and are not suitable for mission-critical workloads.
