The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:

Option (C) is the most suitable solution in this scenario as it allows for easy deployment of OS patches using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, while also providing a centralized location for recording and tracking configuration changes using AWS Config. This approach ensures that all EC2 instances are patched and up-to-date, reducing the risk of cyber security attacks.

Option (A) does not provide a comprehensive solution for recording and tracking configuration changes, while Option (B) requires more manual intervention and may not be as scalable as Option (C). Option (D) is not a viable solution as it does not address the immediate need to mitigate the security risk.
