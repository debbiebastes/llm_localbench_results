An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

To meet the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, you should choose option B - Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.

EBS (Elastic Block Store) volumes are designed to provide persistent block-level storage for Amazon EC2 instances. They are ideal for storing data that requires a high level of availability and durability, such as mission-critical workloads.

Option A - Attach an instance store volume - is not suitable for this requirement because instance store volumes are temporary and are lost when the instance is terminated or stopped.

Option C - Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA - is not suitable because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a cold storage service that is optimized for infrequently accessed data, and it may not provide the high level of availability and durability required for mission-critical workloads.

Option D - Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA - is not suitable because, as mentioned earlier, instance store volumes are temporary and are lost when the instance is terminated or stopped.

Therefore, option B - Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance - is the best choice for meeting the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads.
