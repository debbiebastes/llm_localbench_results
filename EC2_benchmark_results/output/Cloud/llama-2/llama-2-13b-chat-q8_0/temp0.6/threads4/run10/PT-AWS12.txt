A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation: If the application being hosted will be used for more than 3 years, it would be the most cost-effective option to go with the No Upfront, Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. With this option, you pay less upfront and have the ability to convert your instances to On-Demand or Standard Reserved Instances as needed. This provides the most flexibility and potential cost savings over the long term.

Note: The All Upfront options (A and C) would require a larger upfront payment and may not provide the same level of cost savings as the No Upfront option (B). The Standard Reserved Instance pricing (C) is generally more expensive than the Convertible Reserved Instance pricing (B), so it would not be the most cost-effective option if the application will be used for more than 3 years. The No Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term (D) may provide some cost savings compared to On-Demand instances, but it would not provide the same level of long-term cost savings as the Convertible Reserved Instance pricing (B).
