Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

To achieve optimum performance, it's recommended to have one KCL worker per shard. Since there are six shards now, you should launch at least six EC2 instances. Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch is (D) 6.
