A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

A

Explanation:

The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk would be to use AWS Config rules to detect and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is efficient because it leverages existing AWS services (Config, Lambda, Systems Manager) and automates the remediation process without requiring manual intervention.

Option B is not related to the question, as it involves setting up a Transit VPC, which is not the solution to the security risk described. Option C blocks source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but this approach would not automatically update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address and requires manual intervention. Option D does not provide a direct solution to the security risk, as it only monitors and detects security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but does not remediate the issue automatically.
