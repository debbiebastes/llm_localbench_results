A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

The correct answer is (C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.

Explanation:

CloudFront can be used to act as a caching layer in front of the API Gateway, which will help to reduce the load on the backend systems by caching frequently requested data. This will help to protect the backend systems from traffic spikes and improve the overall performance of the platform.

Option (A) is not the best choice because EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling are more suitable for handling sudden spikes in traffic, rather than caching. Option (B) is also not the best choice as throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway can only limit the number of requests and do not provide a caching layer. Option (D) will not have any impact on the performance of the platform during traffic spikes.
