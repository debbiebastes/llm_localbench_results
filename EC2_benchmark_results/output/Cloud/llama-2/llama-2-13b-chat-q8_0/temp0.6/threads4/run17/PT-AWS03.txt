A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation: 
Automatically detecting and updating the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using AWS Config rules is the most efficient way to remediate this security risk. By using a Systems Manager Automation document associated with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule, the security group can be updated with the corporate firewall IP address automatically. This approach eliminates the need for manual intervention and ensures that all affected security groups are updated consistently across the environment.

The other options do not fully address the issue:

(B) Setting up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances does not directly remediate the security risk. It may help in the future, but it is not an efficient solution for this specific issue.

(C) Blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACLs would only block traffic from unknown sources, which might not be effective in this case since the developers are using known IP addresses.

(D) Using AWS Shield to monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is not an efficient solution for remediation as it would only provide alerts and notifications, but would not automatically update the security groups.
