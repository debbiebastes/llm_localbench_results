An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

The correct answer is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Option (A) will not meet the requirement for mission-critical workloads, as instance store volumes are not designed for persistent storage and do not provide the required level of durability and performance.

Option (C) is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA does not support lifecycle policies for object transitioning to Glacier.

Option (D) is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA does not support the use of instance store volumes.

Attaching an EBS volume in your EC2 instance will provide a persistent block storage volume that can be used for mission-critical workloads. Using Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier will ensure that your backup data is stored in a durable and cost-effective manner, while also meeting the requirement of storing the data for at least 30 days.
