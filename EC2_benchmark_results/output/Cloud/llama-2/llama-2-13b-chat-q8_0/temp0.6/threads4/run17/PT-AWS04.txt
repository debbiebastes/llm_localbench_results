Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(B) 12

Explanation:

When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards should be increased to handle more data. To achieve optimum performance, you should launch at least one EC2 instance per shard. Therefore, for six open shards, you should launch six EC2 instances.

However, the maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched is limited by the availability of resources such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. In this case, since each instance has one KCL worker, we can assume that each instance requires approximately equal resources. Therefore, to achieve optimum performance, you should launch 12 EC2 instances, which is the maximum number that can be supported by the available resources.

Answer: (B) 12
