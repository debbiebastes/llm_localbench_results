A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:
The cost of running an On-Demand EC2 instance and a Reserved EC2 instance are as follows:

On-Demand EC2: $0.085 per hour x 24 hours per day = $2016 per year
Reserved EC2 (All Upfront): $3,792 per year (pay upfront for the entire year)
Reserved EC2 (No Upfront): $3,448 per year (no upfront payment, pay hourly)

If the application being hosted is used for more than 3 years, then it would be more cost-effective to use a Reserved EC2 instance with No Upfront pricing for a 3-year term. This option provides the lowest total cost of ownership over the 3-year period.

Here's the calculation:

Year 1:
On-Demand EC2: $2016 per year
Reserved EC2 (No Upfront): $3,448 per year

Year 2:
On-Demand EC2: $2016 per year
Reserved EC2 (No Upfront): $3,448 per year

Year 3:
On-Demand EC2: $2016 per year
Reserved EC2 (No Upfront): $3,448 per year

Total Cost of Ownership for 3 years:
On-Demand EC2: $6,056
Reserved EC2 (No Upfront): $9,744

Therefore, the most cost-effective option is (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
