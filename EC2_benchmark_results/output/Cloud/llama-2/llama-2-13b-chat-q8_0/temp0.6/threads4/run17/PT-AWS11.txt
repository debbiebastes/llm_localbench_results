Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

EventBridge, formerly known as AWS CloudWatch Events, is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed events bus that allows you to subscribe to custom events generated by other AWS services or your own applications. With EventBridge, you can easily integrate your applications with other AWS services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, or Amazon EC2, and receive notifications when specific events occur.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) provides a fully managed message queue service that enables you to decouple the components of your application architecture, but it does not provide event-driven functionality like EventBridge.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a fully managed messaging service that sends messages or push notifications to multiple subscribers or clients, but it is not designed for decoupling application components.

Amazon Kinesis is a fully managed service that enables you to build real-time data streaming applications, but it does not provide event-driven functionality like EventBridge.
