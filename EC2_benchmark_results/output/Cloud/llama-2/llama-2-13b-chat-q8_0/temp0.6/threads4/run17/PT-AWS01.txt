A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 

Explanation:

The security engineer should implement client-side encryption of the sensitive PII data stored in the Amazon S3 bucket to ensure that the data remains protected even if the S3 bucket is accessed by an unauthorized entity. By using a KMS-managed customer master key, the data will be encrypted on the client-side before it is sent to AWS, ensuring that the sensitive PII data remains secure and protected throughout the storage process. This approach also eliminates the need for storing the master keys in AWS, which helps to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. 

The other options are not suitable for this scenario:

A) Client-side encryption with a client-side master key is not recommended as it can be compromised if the client's system is breached.

C) Server-side encryption with a KMS managed key requires storing the master keys in AWS, which goes against the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company.

D) Server-side encryption with customer provided key can be risky as the customer may not have proper security controls to protect their key.
