An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B. Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

* An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume is a block-level storage volume that is attached to an EC2 instance and provides persistent storage for the instance.
* Amazon S3 is an object storage service that stores data in a flat, hierarchical structure called a bucket.
* A lifecycle policy can be configured on an S3 bucket to transition objects to Glacier after 30 days.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it meets all the requirements:

* Provides persistent storage for the instance in the form of an EBS volume.
* Uses Amazon S3 for storing backup data and configures a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Glacier after 30 days.

Note that option A is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads and do not provide persistent storage. Option C is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not designed for long-term archival storage, unlike Amazon S3 Glacier. Option D is incorrect because it does not use an EBS volume for persistent storage.
