Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12

Explanation: 

When resharding your Kinesis data stream, you can increase the number of open shards to improve processing performance. With six open shards, each EC2 instance can process three shards simultaneously. To achieve optimum performance, you should launch 12 EC2 instances, as each instance can handle three shards. This provides a total of 36 shards for your application to process.

Note: The above answer is based on the assumption that one EC2 instance can handle one KCL worker. If each instance can handle multiple workers, you may need to adjust the number of instances accordingly.
