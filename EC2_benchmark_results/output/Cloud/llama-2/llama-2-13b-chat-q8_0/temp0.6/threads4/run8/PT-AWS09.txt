A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:

Option A is not the best solution because it would require significant changes to the existing architecture, and might not be able to handle sudden spikes in traffic as effectively as option B.

Option C is not the best solution because CloudFront would only act as a cache for static assets and would not help with handling sudden spikes in traffic.

Option D is not relevant to the scenario.

Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway would be the best approach to handle traffic spikes, as it would allow the platform to manage and control the amount of traffic that reaches the backend systems, and also cache the results of frequently accessed APIs to reduce the load on the backend systems. This will help ensure that the platform can handle the increased traffic without compromising its performance or availability.
