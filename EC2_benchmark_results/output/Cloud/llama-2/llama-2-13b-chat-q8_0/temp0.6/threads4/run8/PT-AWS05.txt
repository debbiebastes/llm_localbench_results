A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

Option C is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements because it allows for real-time tracking of changes made to items in DynamoDB, without the need to set up an additional database or synchronization mechanism. By creating an Amazon EventBridge rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, any new changes made to items in the primary table will trigger a Lambda function, which can then process and save the changes to the secondary table. This approach is efficient, scalable, and eliminates the need for manual intervention or custom coding.

Option A (Set up DynamoDB Accelerator) is not relevant to this scenario as it only improves performance for certain types of read-heavy workloads.

Option B (Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery) would allow for the creation of a backup of the primary table, but it would not automatically sync the changes to the secondary table. Additionally, enabling point-in-time recovery would require manual intervention to restore the backup.

Option D (Enable DynamoDB Streams) would require additional setup and configuration to process the stream events, whereas option C provides a simpler solution with less overhead.
