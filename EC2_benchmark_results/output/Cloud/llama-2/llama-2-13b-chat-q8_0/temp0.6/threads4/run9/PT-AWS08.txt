An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
B

Reason:
Option B is the best choice for meeting the requirements of a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, as it uses an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume which provides persistent storage that is suitable for such workloads. Additionally, using Amazon S3 to store backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier will provide the necessary storage for long-term archiving, while also ensuring that the data is stored in a highly durable and available storage solution.
