The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the company’s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

C. Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the best solution is to use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. This will ensure that all instances are patched with the latest security updates. Additionally, setting up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes will provide an audit trail of the changes made.

Option A is not suitable because it only provides a limited solution for deploying patches using Systems Manager Sessions Manager, and does not provide a comprehensive patch management solution. Option B is also not suitable because it uses Amazon ES which is not the best tool for tracking configuration changes. Option D is not suitable because it does not address the immediate security risk and does not provide an audit trail of the changes made.
