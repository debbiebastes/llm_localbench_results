A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 

The MOST likely root cause of this issue is option (A) - There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend. When a Lambda function returns an output that is not in the correct format or structure, it can cause the Amazon API Gateway to return a 502 Bad Gateway error. In this case, the developer mentioned that the underlying function properly returned the result in XML format, so option (A) is the most likely root cause of the issue.
