A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:

API Gateway can be configured with throttling limits to restrict the number of requests that can be made within a certain time frame, preventing overload on the backend systems. Additionally, enabling result caching in API Gateway can help reduce the number of requests made to the backend systems by storing frequently accessed data in memory for faster access.

Option (A) would not be effective as it would require significant changes to the existing architecture and may not provide immediate relief from traffic spikes. Option (C) would also not be effective as CloudFront is a CDN, it will not help with throttling or caching. Option (D) does not address the issue of traffic spikes.
