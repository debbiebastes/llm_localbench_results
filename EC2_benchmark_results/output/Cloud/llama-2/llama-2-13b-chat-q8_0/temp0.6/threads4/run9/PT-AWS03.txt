A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
(A) Using AWS Config rules, Systems Manager Automation document, and AWS Lambda function would be the most efficient way to remediate this security risk. This approach enables continuous monitoring of security groups and automated remediation in real-time.

Explanation:

Option (B) setting up a Transit VPC is not related to the solution and would not automatically remediate the security risk.

Option (C) blocking source IP addresses using Network ACLs might be part of the solution, but it would not address the root cause of the issue, which is the unauthorized configuration of security groups.

Option (D) using AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range would be a good additional measure but not the most efficient way to remediate the risk as it does not provide real-time automated remediation.
