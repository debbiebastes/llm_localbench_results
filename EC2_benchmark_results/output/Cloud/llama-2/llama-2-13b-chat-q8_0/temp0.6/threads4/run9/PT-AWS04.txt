Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

To calculate the maximum number of EC2 instances needed for optimal performance, we need to consider a few factors.

Firstly, each KCL worker can handle one shard at a time, so if there are six open shards, we need at least six KCL workers to process all the data streams.

Secondly, since each instance can only handle one shard, we need to ensure that each instance is assigned a unique shard to prevent conflicts and improve performance.

Lastly, we should aim for a balance between the number of instances and the workload, so that no single instance is overwhelmed with too much work.

Based on these factors, the maximum number of EC2 instances needed for optimum performance would be:

(D) 6

Each instance can handle one shard, and there are six open shards, so we need at least six instances to process all the data streams without any conflicts or overloading.
