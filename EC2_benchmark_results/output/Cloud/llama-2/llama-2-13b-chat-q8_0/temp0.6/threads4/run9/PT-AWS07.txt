A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

Correct Answer: C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation:

The issue described in the question is typical of workloads that experience variable traffic throughout the day, with higher usage during office hours. In this case, the best approach is to use a scheduled scaling policy to launch additional instances before the start of the day, when traffic is low. This will ensure that the application has enough resources available to handle the increased traffic during peak hours.

Option A, Predictive scaling, is not a good fit for this scenario because it relies on historical data to predict future usage patterns, and may not be effective in addressing the variable traffic pattern described in the question.

Option B, Dynamic scaling based on memory utilization, may not be effective in addressing the issue either, as the increased traffic during peak hours is likely to be caused by a sudden surge of users rather than a gradual increase in memory usage.

Option D, Dynamic scaling based on CPU utilization, is also not a good fit for this scenario because it may not account for the variable traffic pattern and may result in over-provisioning or under-provisioning of instances.

Therefore, the most operationally efficient solution to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day is to configure a scheduled scaling policy that launches new instances before the start of the day, based on historical traffic patterns or other relevant factors.
