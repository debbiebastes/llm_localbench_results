A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

Option C is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements because it allows for real-time tracking of changes made to the items in DynamoDB, without the need for manual intervention or complex data replication. By using Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events), you can create a rule that triggers when new items are added, updated, or deleted in DynamoDB. The Lambda function set as a target for the rule will then process and save the new changes to the other table.

Option A, DynamoDB Accelerator, is not relevant for this scenario because it is used for optimizing read performance of large-scale applications and does not provide real-time data replication.

Option B, Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables, may not be the most efficient approach as it requires manual intervention and can lead to increased storage costs. Additionally, this option does not provide real-time data replication.

Option D, Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table, is also a viable solution but may require additional setup and configuration compared to Option C.
