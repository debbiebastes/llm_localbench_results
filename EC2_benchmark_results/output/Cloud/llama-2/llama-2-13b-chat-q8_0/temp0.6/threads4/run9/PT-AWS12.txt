A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:
The most cost-effective option would be to choose the No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term, as it offers the lowest hourly price and eliminates upfront costs. Although the All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term (Option A) may provide a discount compared to On-Demand pricing for the first year, it still requires an upfront payment that could be avoided with the No Upfront option.

The All Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term (Option C) is more expensive than the No Upfront option and doesn't offer any additional benefits. The No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year (Option D) would result in higher overall costs due to the repeated upfront payments.
