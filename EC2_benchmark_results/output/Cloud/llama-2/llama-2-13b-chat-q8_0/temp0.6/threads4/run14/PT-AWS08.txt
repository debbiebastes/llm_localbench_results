An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
B

Explanation:

To meet the requirement of a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, option (B) is the best choice. EBS (Elastic Block Store) volumes provide persistent block-level storage that can be attached to an EC2 instance. They are optimized for use cases that require high throughput and low latency, such as databases, file systems, and applications.

Option (A) suggests using an instance store volume, which is a type of storage that is stored within the EC2 instance itself. While instance store volumes provide faster access times than EBS volumes, they are not suitable for mission-critical workloads because they are not persistent and can be lost if the instance is terminated or replaced.

Option (C) suggests using Amazon S3 to store backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA after 30 days. While Amazon S3 is a highly available and durable object storage service, it is not designed for block-level storage and would not provide the necessary persistence for mission-critical workloads.

Option (D) is similar to option (A) and is not a viable choice for the same reason.
