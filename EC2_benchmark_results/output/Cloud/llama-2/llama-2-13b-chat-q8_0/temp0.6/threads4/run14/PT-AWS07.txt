A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation:

A scheduled scaling policy would allow you to launch new instances before the start of the day, when the demand is anticipated to increase. This approach ensures that the additional resources are available before users start accessing the application, and it also eliminates the need for predictive scaling or dynamic scaling based on CPU or memory utilization.

Option A (Predictive scaling) may not be the best choice as it would require historical data to anticipate the demand and adjust the instances accordingly. Option B (Dynamic scaling based on Memory utilization) may also not be the best choice as memory utilization may not be the best indicator of demand, especially during the start of the day when users are just starting to access the application. Option D (Dynamic scaling based on CPU utilization) may not be the best choice either as it would require more complex configuration and monitoring of CPU utilization.

Therefore, option C (Scheduled scaling policy) is the most operationally efficient solution to ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day.
