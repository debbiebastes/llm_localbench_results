A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:

The cost of using an On-Demand EC2 instance will be more expensive than using a Reserved EC2 instance. However, the most cost-effective option would be to use a No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance for a 3-year term, as this option offers the lowest total cost of ownership.

The No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing is calculated based on the usage of the instance and offers discounts compared to On-Demand pricing. The 3-year term provides a longer commitment period, which will result in additional discounts.

Option A, All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term, would not provide the same level of discounts as Option B, and would be more expensive overall.

Option C, All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term, would also not provide the same level of discounts as Option B, and would be more expensive overall.

Option D, No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year, would not provide the same level of discounts as Option B, and would be more expensive overall.
