A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation: 

* Client-side encryption ensures that the data is encrypted before it is sent to AWS, which helps to protect the data from unauthorized access during transit.
* Using a KMS-managed customer master key provides an additional layer of security as the key is securely managed by AWS, and never needs to be stored or transmitted.
* This approach ensures that the sensitive PII data remains encrypted at all times, even when it is stored in the S3 bucket, and only authorized users can access it with the proper decryption key.

Option A is incorrect because it uses a client-side master key, which may not be secure enough. Option C is incorrect because it uses a server-side encryption, which does not provide the same level of security as client-side encryption. Option D is incorrect because it allows the customer to provide their own encryption key, which may not meet the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company.
