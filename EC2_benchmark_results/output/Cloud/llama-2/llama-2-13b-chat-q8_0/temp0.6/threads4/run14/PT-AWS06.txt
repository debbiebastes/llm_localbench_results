A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation: A 502 Bad Gateway error typically indicates that the gateway (in this case, the Amazon API Gateway) received an invalid response from the backend (the Lambda function). The fact that the developer was able to successfully invoke the underlying function suggests that the function is working correctly and returning a valid output. Therefore, the most likely root cause of the issue is that the output returned from the Lambda function is incompatible with the API Gateway's expected format or structure.
