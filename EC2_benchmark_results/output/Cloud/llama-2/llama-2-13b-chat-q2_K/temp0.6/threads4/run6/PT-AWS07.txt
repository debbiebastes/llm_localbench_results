A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances.

Explanation:

The most operationally efficient solution to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day is to configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group. This will allow the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of instances based on historical usage patterns and forecasted demand, ensuring that there are enough instances available to handle the increased traffic during the start of the day.

Option (B) is not the best solution as Dynamic scaling based on Memory utilization may not be effective in predicting the need for additional instances during the start of the day. Option (C) is also not the best solution as Scheduled scaling may not be able to adjust to changing demand patterns during the day. Option (D) is not the best solution as CPU utilization may not be the best indicator of demand during the start of the day.
