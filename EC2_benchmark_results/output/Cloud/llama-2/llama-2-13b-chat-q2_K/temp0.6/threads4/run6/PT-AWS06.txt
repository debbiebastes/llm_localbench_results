A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 

A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend. 

The error 502 indicates that the gateway received an invalid response from the server, which suggests that the output from the Lambda function is incompatible with the API Gateway's expectations. This is the most likely root cause of the issue, as it highlights a mismatch between the Lambda function's output format and the expected format for the API Gateway integration.
