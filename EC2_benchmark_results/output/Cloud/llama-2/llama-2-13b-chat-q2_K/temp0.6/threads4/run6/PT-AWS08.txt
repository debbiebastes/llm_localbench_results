An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B. Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume is a persistent storage option that is well-suited for mission-critical workloads. Attaching an EBS volume to your EC2 instance will provide a more reliable and persistent storage solution compared to an instance store volume.

Using Amazon S3 to store your backup data is a good choice because it provides a highly durable and scalable storage option. You can also configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which will help reduce storage costs by moving infrequently accessed data to a more cost-effective storage class.

Option A is not the best choice because instance store volumes are not persistent and may be lost if the instance is terminated or deleted. Option C is also not the best choice because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a more expensive storage option compared to Amazon S3 Glacier. Option D is incorrect because instance store volumes are not persistent and cannot be used for mission-critical workloads.
