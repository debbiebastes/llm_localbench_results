A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Rationale:

The hospital wants to ensure that sensitive PII data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, and should never be sent to AWS in plain text. By using a KMS-managed customer master key for client-side encryption, the data will be encrypted on the client-side before it is sent to S3, and the master key will never be sent to AWS. Additionally, this approach will provide an additional layer of security as the master key will be stored securely in the hospital's environment, rather than in AWS.

Note: The KMS-managed customer master key should be generated by the hospital using Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) and should be stored securely in their environment.
