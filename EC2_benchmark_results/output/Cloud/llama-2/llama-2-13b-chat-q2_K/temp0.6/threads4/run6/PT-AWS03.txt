A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:

The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is to use AWS Config rules to detect and remediate the security groups that allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range without any approval. By associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule, the security group can be updated with the corporate firewall IP address to block the direct traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. This approach is efficient because it automates the remediation process and eliminates the need for manual intervention.

Option B, setting up a Transit VPC, is not relevant to this scenario as it only provides connectivity between VPCs and does not address the direct traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Option C, blocking source IP addresses, is also not relevant as it would block all traffic from the specified IP addresses, regardless of whether they are authorized or not. Option D, using AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups, is not a remediation solution but rather a detection one.
