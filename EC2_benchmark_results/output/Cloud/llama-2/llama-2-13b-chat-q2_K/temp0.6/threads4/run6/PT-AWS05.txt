A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 

Correct answer is C.

Explanation:

Option (A) sets up DynamoDB Accelerator, which can improve performance but does not address the requirement of recording changes in another table.

Option (B) enables DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery, which allows for restoring a database to a previous state, but it does not provide real-time updates of new changes made to the items in the table.

Option (D) enables DynamoDB Streams, which provides real-time updates of new changes made to the items in the table, but it requires more complex configuration and can also increase costs.

Option (C) creates an Amazon EventBridge rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements, as it allows for real-time updates of new changes made to the items in the original table, without requiring complex configuration or increasing costs.
