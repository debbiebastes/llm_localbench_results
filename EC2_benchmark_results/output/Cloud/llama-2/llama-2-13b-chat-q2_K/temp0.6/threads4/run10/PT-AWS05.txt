A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 

C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

* Option A, Setting up DynamoDB Accelerator, is not related to recording changes made to items in DynamoDB.
* Option B, Enabling DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery, would create a backup of the table but does not automatically sync new changes with another table.
* Option D, Enabling DynamoDB Streams, would allow for real-time streaming of data updates, but would require additional infrastructure and maintenance.

Option C, Creating an Amazon EventBridge rule, is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements, as it allows for tracking table-level events in DynamoDB and triggers a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach is scalable, flexible, and requires minimal additional infrastructure.
