A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Rationale:

The most cost-effective option would be to choose the No Upfront, Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option offers the lowest hourly price among all options and provides the flexibility of converting to On-Demand instances if usage changes over time. By opting for a 3-year term, the company can lock in a lower hourly rate for a longer period, which would result in significant cost savings over the long run.
