A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 

The most likely root cause of this issue is option (A): there is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend. When using an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration, it's important to ensure that the output format of the underlying function matches the expected output format of the API. If the output format is not compatible, it can result in a 502 Bad Gateway error. To resolve this issue, the developer should review the output format of the Lambda function and ensure that it is compatible with the expected output format of the API.
