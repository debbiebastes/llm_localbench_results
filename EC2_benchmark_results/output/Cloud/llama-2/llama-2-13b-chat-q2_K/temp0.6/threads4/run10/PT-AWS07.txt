A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances.

Explanation: A predictive scaling policy can help ensure that the application performs optimally at the start of the day by proactively adjusting the number of instances based on historical usage patterns and predicted workloads. This approach allows for more efficient utilization of resources, reduces the risk of slow performance during peak hours, and aligns with the operational requirements of the business.

In contrast, dynamic scaling based on memory or CPU utilization may not be as effective in addressing the specific needs of this application, as it may lead to over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources. Scheduled scaling may also not be suitable, as it may not account for variations in workloads throughout the day.
