Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(B) 12

Explanation:
The formula for calculating the maximum number of EC2 instances needed is:
Maximum number of instances = (Total number of shards x Number of workers per shard) / 2.

In this case, we have four shards and one worker per shard, so:

Maximum number of instances = (4 x 1) / 2 = 2.

Since you need at least two instances to run in parallel, the maximum number of instances that should be launched is 2, which is option B.
