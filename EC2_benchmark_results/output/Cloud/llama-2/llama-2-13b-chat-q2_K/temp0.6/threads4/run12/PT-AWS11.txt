Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).

Amazon EventBridge is a fully managed service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a scalable, high-throughput, and highly available infrastructure for handling events in real-time. With Amazon EventBridge, you can create event buses that enable loosely coupled microservices to communicate with each other without needing to know the details of each other's implementation.

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a message queuing service that enables you to decouple the components of your application architecture and handle messages in a reliable and highly available manner. However, it does not provide event-driven functionality like Amazon EventBridge.

Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a fully managed messaging service that sends messages or push notifications to multiple subscribers or clients. It can be used for event-driven architectures but is not the best fit for decoupling components of an application.

Amazon Kinesis is a fully managed streaming service that enables you to build real-time data pipelines and stream data from various sources into AWS services, such as Amazon S3 or Amazon Redshift. While it can be used for event-driven architectures, it does not provide the same level of decoupling as Amazon EventBridge.
