Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12

Explanation:

To achieve optimum performance, the number of EC2 instances should be equal to the number of open shards (six in this case) times the number of worker threads per instance (one in this case). Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that should be launched is 6 x 1 = 6.

Answer: (B) 12
