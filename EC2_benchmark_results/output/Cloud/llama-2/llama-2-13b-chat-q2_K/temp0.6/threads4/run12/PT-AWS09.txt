A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

In this scenario, you should protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes by using a combination of all the above options. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.

Explanation: 

* Option A: Switching to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling will provide better performance and availability for the backend systems of the platform. This option will also help in handling traffic spikes more efficiently.

Option B: Enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway can help in managing traffic spikes, but it may not be enough to handle a significant increase in site visitors and new users.

Option C: Using CloudFront in front of the API Gateway can act as a cache and help in handling traffic spikes, but it may not be enough to handle a significant increase in site visitors and new users.

Option D: Moving the Lambda function in a VPC will provide better security and isolation, but it may not have a direct impact on handling traffic spikes.
