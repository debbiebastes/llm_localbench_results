A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Rationale: The KMS-managed customer master key should be used to encrypt the data, which will be stored in S3. This approach ensures that the sensitive data is protected by the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. Additionally, the client-side encryption ensures that data remains encrypted even when it's being transferred from the hospital's application to AWS.

Amazon S3 provides several encryption methods, including server-side encryption, client-side encryption, and hybrid encryption. However, for this scenario, we should use client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key to ensure that the sensitive data remains secure and compliant with the company's requirements.

Therefore, option B is the best answer.
