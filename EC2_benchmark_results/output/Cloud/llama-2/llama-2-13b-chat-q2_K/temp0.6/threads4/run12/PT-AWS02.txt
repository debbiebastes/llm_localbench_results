The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Rationale:

Option (A) does not address the risk associated with outdated operating systems, as it only provides a way to manage patches for supported operating systems. Option (B) does not provide a solution for recording and tracking configuration changes. Option (D) is not suitable as it does not address the immediate security risk of outdated operating systems.

Option (C) provides an effective solution by using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances, which will mitigate the security risk immediately. Additionally, setting up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes will provide a complete audit trail of all changes made to the instances. Therefore, option (C) is the most suitable solution in this scenario.
