An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B. Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume is a persistent storage option for EC2 instances, and it is the best choice for mission-critical workloads. Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides highly durable and available storage for data. By attaching an EBS volume to your EC2 instance and storing your backup data in Amazon S3, you can ensure that your data is persistent and easily recoverable in case of an outage or system failure.

Option B is the correct answer because it meets all the requirements mentioned in the question:

* Persistent storage for mission-critical workloads (EBS volume)
* Backup data stored in Amazon S3
* Data transitioned to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days (lifecycle policy)

Option A is incorrect because instance store volumes are not persistent and are not suitable for mission-critical workloads. Option C is also incorrect because One Zone-IA is not a storage class, and it does not provide the same level of durability and availability as Amazon S3. Option D is incorrect because backup data should be stored in Amazon S3, not instance store.
