A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

Option A is not ideal because it requires significant setup and maintenance, and may not provide real-time updates.

Option B is not ideal because it only provides point-in-time recovery, and may not capture all recent changes.

Option D is not ideal because it requires significant setup and maintenance, and may not provide real-time updates.

Option C is the most ideal solution because it allows for real-time tracking of table-level events in DynamoDB, and can be easily integrated with a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach provides the most efficient and scalable way to comply with the requirements.
