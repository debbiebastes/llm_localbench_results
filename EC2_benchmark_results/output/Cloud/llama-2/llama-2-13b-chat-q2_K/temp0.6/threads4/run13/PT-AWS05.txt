A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 

The most ideal way to comply with the requirements is option C, creating an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Setting a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach allows for real-time processing of new changes without the need for manual intervention or periodic syncs, ensuring compliance with the requirements.

Option A, setting up DynamoDB Accelerator, is not necessary in this scenario as it's designed for improving performance and not for compliance purposes. Option B, enabling DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery, would require manual intervention to sync the tables periodically, which goes against the requirement of real-time processing. Option D, enabling DynamoDB Streams, would also require manual intervention to process and save new changes to the other table. Additionally, DynamoDB Streams are not designed for real-time processing, and may introduce additional latency in the system.

Therefore, option C is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements of recording all new changes made to the items in DynamoDB in another DynamoDB table in another region.
