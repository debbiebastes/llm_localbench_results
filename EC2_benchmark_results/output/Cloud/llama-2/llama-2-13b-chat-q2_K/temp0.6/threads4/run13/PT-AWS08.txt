An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Option B is the correct answer because it meets all the requirements mentioned in the question.

* An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume provides persistent storage, which is suitable for mission-critical workloads.
* Using Amazon S3 to store backup data ensures that the data is stored in a highly durable and scalable storage solution.
* Configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days ensures that the backup data is stored in an infrequently accessed, but still accessible, storage solution.

Option A is incorrect because instance store volumes are not persistent and are not suitable for mission-critical workloads. Option C is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a low-latency storage solution that is not designed for long-term storage of backup data. Option D is incorrect because the lifecycle policy should be configured to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier, not Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
