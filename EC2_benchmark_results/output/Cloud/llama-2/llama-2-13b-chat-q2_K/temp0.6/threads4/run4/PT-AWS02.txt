The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation: In this scenario, setting up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager is the most suitable solution because it provides a centralized and automated way to deploy OS patches to the outdated EC2 instances. Additionally, using Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes ensures compliance and audit purposes. Deploying the patches using Systems Manager Sessions Manager or AWS Config would also be effective solutions, but they may not provide as much visibility into configuration changes.

Option D is not a suitable solution because it does not address the immediate security risk and would not provide adequate visibility into configuration changes for audit purposes.
