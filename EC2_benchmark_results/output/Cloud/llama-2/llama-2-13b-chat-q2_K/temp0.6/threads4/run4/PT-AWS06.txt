A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation: When the developer received a 502 Bad Gateway error, it suggests that there is an issue with the response from the upstream service (in this case, the Lambda function). Since the developer was able to properly return the result in XML format when invoking the underlying function, the problem likely lies with the output being returned by the Lambda proxy integration. Option A is the most likely root cause of this issue.
