A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

Option C is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements because it utilizes Amazon EventBridge, which is a fully managed service that provides real-time event processing and delivery. By creating an EventBridge rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, new changes made to items in the source table will be automatically detected and sent to the target Lambda function for processing and saving to the other table.

Option A, DynamoDB Accelerator, is not relevant in this scenario as it is a feature that accelerates data transfer between AWS services, but does not provide real-time event processing.

Option D, Enable DynamoDB Streams, is also not ideal because it requires manual configuration and maintenance of the stream, as well as additional infrastructure costs. Additionally, DynamoDB Streams do not provide real-time event processing, which may result in missed events.

Therefore, Option C provides the most efficient and cost-effective solution for complying with the requirements.
