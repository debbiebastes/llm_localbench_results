Answer: 

* The correct answer is (A) Security Perspective.

Explanation: When migrating to AWS, security is of paramount importance. Ensuring the protection of sensitive data and applications is crucial for any organization, and it’s especially true for e-commerce companies that handle customer information and financial transactions. The Security Perspective of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) provides a structured approach to securing workloads in the cloud, including best practices for identity and access management, encryption, network security, and compliance. By focusing on the Security Perspective, the e-commerce company can ensure that its migration to AWS is secure, reliable, and compliant with relevant regulations.
