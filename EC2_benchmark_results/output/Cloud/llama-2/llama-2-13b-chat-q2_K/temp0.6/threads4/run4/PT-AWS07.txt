A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances.

Explanation:

The most operationally efficient solution is to implement a predictive scaling policy that can anticipate and adjust for the increased demand during the start of the day. This will ensure that the application performs optimally at the beginning of the day when the users are most active. The predictive scaling policy can analyze historical usage patterns, current utilization, and other relevant metrics to determine the optimal number of instances to deploy during peak hours.

Option A is the best choice because it allows for automatic adjustment based on demand, which minimizes manual intervention and ensures efficient resource allocation. Options B, C, and D do not address the specific use case of ensuring performance at the beginning of the day.
