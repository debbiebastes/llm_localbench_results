A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:

To ensure that sensitive PII data is stored securely in AWS, the Security Engineer should implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach allows for strong encryption of the data both in transit and at rest, without requiring the unencrypted data to be sent to AWS. By using a KMS-managed key, the master key is securely stored and managed by AWS Key Management Service (KMS), ensuring that it is never exposed or accessible to unauthorized users.

Option A is incorrect because client-side encryption does not provide the same level of security as server-side encryption, and the unencrypted data may still be accessible to unauthorized users. Option C is also incorrect because customer-provided keys are not recommended for sensitive data storage in AWS. Option D is incorrect because server-side encryption is not enabled for the S3 bucket.
