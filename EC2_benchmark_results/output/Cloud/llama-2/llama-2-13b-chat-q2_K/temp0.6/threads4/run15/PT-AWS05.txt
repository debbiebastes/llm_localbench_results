A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 

A) Setting up DynamoDB Accelerator is not the most ideal way to comply with the requirements, as it only provides a small performance boost for read-heavy workloads and does not support real-time data replication or point-in-time recovery.

B) Enabling DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery would ensure that all new changes made to items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region, but it is a manual process that requires a manual trigger to initiate the backup process.

C) Creating an Amazon EventBridge rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB would allow for real-time monitoring of changes made to items in DynamoDB, but it may not be able to capture all changes made to the items.

D) Enabling DynamoDB Streams would provide real-time data replication to the other DynamoDB table, but it may require additional setup and configuration to ensure that all new changes are captured and processed in a timely manner.

Therefore, the most ideal way to comply with the requirements is:

(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach provides real-time monitoring of changes made to items in DynamoDB and allows for automated processing of new changes in the other table.
