Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 

(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Explanation: Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a scalable, managed service for passing events between microservices or other applications. With EventBridge, you can create event filters to specify which events you want to receive and how you want to receive them, allowing you to build more flexible and loosely coupled architectures.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is an AWS messaging service that enables you to decouple the components of your application architecture by queuing and delivering messages between them. However, it does not provide the same level of event-driven functionality as EventBridge.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a fully managed messaging service that sends messages or push notifications to multiple subscribers or clients. It can be used for event-driven architecture, but it doesn't provide the same level of flexibility and control as EventBridge.

Amazon Kinesis is an AWS service that enables you to build real-time data processing applications. However, it does not provide the same level of decoupling and event-driven functionality as EventBridge.
