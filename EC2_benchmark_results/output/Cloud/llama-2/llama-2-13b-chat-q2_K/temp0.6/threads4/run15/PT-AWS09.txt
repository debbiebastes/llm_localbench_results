A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:
When there is an increase in traffic, API Gateway can become overwhelmed and start to return errors or timeouts. To protect the backend systems from traffic spikes, throttling limits and result caching can be enabled in API Gateway. Throttling limits control the number of requests that are allowed to reach the backend, while result caching stores the results of previous requests to reduce the load on the backend.

Option (A) is incorrect because EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling are also vulnerable to traffic spikes and may not be able to handle the increased traffic. Option (C) is incorrect because CloudFront is a CDN and does not provide throttling or caching features. Option (D) is incorrect because moving the Lambda function to a VPC would not address the issue of traffic spikes.
