An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Option A is the best choice for meeting the requirements of a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, as it provides the most flexibility and scalability. Attaching an instance store volume to an existing EC2 instance will provide a persistent block storage volume that can be used for storing backup data. Using Amazon S3 to store the backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier will ensure that the data is stored securely and long-term.

Option B is not the best choice, as EBS volumes are not designed for backup storage and may not provide the same level of durability and availability as instance store volumes. Option C is also not a good choice, as Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not designed for long-term storage and may not meet the requirements for mission-critical workloads. Option D is not a valid option, as instance store volumes are not available in EC2 instances.
