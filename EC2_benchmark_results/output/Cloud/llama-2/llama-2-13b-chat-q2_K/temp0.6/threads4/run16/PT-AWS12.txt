A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:
The most cost-effective option would be to go with the No Upfront, Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option offers the lowest hourly rate and does not require any upfront payments. The hourly rate is discounted compared to the On-Demand instance, making it a cost-effective choice for long-term use. The Convertible Reserved Instance pricing also provides flexibility in case the application usage changes over time.
