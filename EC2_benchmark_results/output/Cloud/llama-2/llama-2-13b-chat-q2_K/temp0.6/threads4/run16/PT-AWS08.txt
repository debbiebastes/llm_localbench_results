An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

Amazon S3 provides persistent storage for mission-critical workloads, whereas instance store volumes are not designed for long-term use. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Attaching an instance store volume in your EC2 instance will provide temporary block storage, but it will not be persistent and may be lost or deleted if the instance is terminated or replaced.

Option B is incorrect because EBS volumes are also not designed for long-term use and may not be suitable for mission-critical workloads.

Option C is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA does not provide persistent storage, and objects in this service will be stored in a single availability zone, which may not meet the requirement of being stored in an object storage service after 30 days.

Option D is incorrect because instance store volumes are not designed for long-term use and may not be suitable for mission-critical workloads.
