A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:

When there's an expected surge in traffic, it's crucial to protect backend systems from sudden spikes that could lead to service disruption or even downtime. One way to address this is by enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Throttling limits can help regulate the number of requests that are allowed to reach the backend, preventing overloading and reducing the risk of service disruption. Result caching can help reduce the load on the backend by storing frequently requested results in memory, so they don't need to be retrieved from the backend every time a request is made.

Option (A) is not the best choice because it involves switching to a more scalable architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling, which might not address the immediate need for traffic management during the expected surge in traffic. Options (C) and (D) are not directly related to traffic management during the expected surge.
