The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the company’s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

A] Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, integrate with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.

Rationale:

* Option A provides a comprehensive solution to address the vulnerability by deploying the OS patches using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, which is specifically designed for managing patches across multiple instances.
* Integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana enables real-time tracking and monitoring of configuration changes, ensuring compliance and audit requirements are met.
* Using multiple tools like AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, Amazon ES, and AWS Config provides a more comprehensive solution but may require additional setup and integration efforts.
* Automatically installing OS patches on a weekly basis may not address the immediate security risk, as it is essential to deploy the patches as soon as possible after discovery.
