Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

To achieve optimum performance, each shard in your Kinesis data stream requires one KCL worker. Therefore, if you increase the number of open shards to six, you will need six KCL workers. As each instance can host one KCL worker, you should launch six EC2 instances to accommodate all six shards.

Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch is (D) 6.
