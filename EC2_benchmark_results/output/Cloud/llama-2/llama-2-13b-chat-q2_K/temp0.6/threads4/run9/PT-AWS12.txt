A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:
The cost-effective option would be to go with the No Upfront, Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option has the lowest total cost of ownership, as there is no upfront payment required and the instance can be converted to other instance types or sizes as needed without any additional costs. Additionally, the 3-year term provides more certainty and stability in terms of pricing and availability compared to a 1-year term.
