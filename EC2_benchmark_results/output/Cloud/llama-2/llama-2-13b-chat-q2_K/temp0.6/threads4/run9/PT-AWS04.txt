Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(B) 12

Explanation:

When there are six open shards, the maximum number of EC2 instances that should be launched is 12. This is because each KCL worker can process one shard at a time, and with six shards, you need 6 workers to process all the data streams simultaneously. Launching more than 12 instances will not improve performance as there are only six shards to process.
