A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation:

When a Lambda function is integrated with an Amazon API Gateway, it creates a proxy integration that forwards incoming requests to the Lambda function. If the output of the Lambda function is not in a format that the API Gateway can process, it will result in a 502 Bad Gateway error. This suggests that the output of the Lambda function is not compatible with the expected output of the API Gateway, causing the error.
