A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 

Rationale: To ensure that the sensitive PII data is never sent to AWS, the Security Engineer should implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This will encrypt the data before it is sent to the S3 bucket, ensuring that even if the data is intercepted during transmission, it will remain encrypted and unreadable. Additionally, using a KMS-managed key will ensure that the master key is securely managed by AWS, further reducing the risk of unauthorized access to the sensitive data.
