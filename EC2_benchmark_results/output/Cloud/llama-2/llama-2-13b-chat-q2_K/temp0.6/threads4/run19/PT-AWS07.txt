A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.

Explanation: The application is experiencing slow performance at the start of the day, indicating that there may not be enough resources available to meet the increased demand during this time. Configuring a Dynamic scaling policy based on Memory utilization would allow the Auto Scaling group to launch additional instances with more memory as needed to handle the increased load during the morning hours. This approach is operationally efficient because it allows for the addition of new instances only when they are needed, reducing waste and minimizing the cost of running unnecessary instances.
