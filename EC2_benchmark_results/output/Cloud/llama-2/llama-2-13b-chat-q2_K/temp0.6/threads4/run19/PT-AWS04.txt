Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12.

Explanation: The maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch is directly proportional to the number of open shards. Since you have six open shards, you should launch 6 times as many EC2 instances as you did previously (i.e., 6 x 5 = 30).

Therefore, the correct answer is 30.
