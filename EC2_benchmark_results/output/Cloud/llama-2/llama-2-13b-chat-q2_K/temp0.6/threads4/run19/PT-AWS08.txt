An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Option (B) is the correct answer because it meets all the requirements listed:

* Persistent block storage: EBS provides persistent block storage, which is ideal for mission-critical workloads.
* Backup data stored in S3: Using S3 as a backup store ensures that backups are stored outside of the EC2 instance and can be easily restored if needed.
* Data archiving in S3 Glacier: After 30 days, data can be transitioned to S3 Glacier for long-term storage at a lower cost.

Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not persistent and may not be suitable for mission-critical workloads. Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a backup store, but rather a storage class that provides infrequently accessed data in a single Availability Zone. Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not persistent and may not be suitable for mission-critical workloads.
