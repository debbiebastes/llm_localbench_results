A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation: This is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements because it leverages the real-time nature of EventBridge and allows for automated processing of new changes in DynamoDB without having to perform manual snapshots or use a separate data store. Additionally, using a Lambda function as a rule target ensures that the changes are processed in real-time, reducing the risk of data inconsistency between the two tables.

Option A is not ideal because it requires additional infrastructure and management, while Option B may not provide real-time processing of new changes. Option D may require additional configuration and maintenance for DynamoDB Streams.
