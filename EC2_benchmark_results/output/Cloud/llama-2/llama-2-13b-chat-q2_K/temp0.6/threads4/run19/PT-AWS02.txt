The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

The correct answer is (C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Rationale:

Option (A) does not provide a solution for recording and tracking changes, which is a critical requirement for audit purposes. Option (B) does not mention using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, which is specifically designed for deploying OS patches. Option (D) is not a suitable solution as it does not address the immediate need to mitigate the security risk.

Option (C) offers an easy way to deploy OS patches using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager and provides a mechanism to record and track configuration changes using AWS Config. This option best fulfills the requirements of the scenario.
