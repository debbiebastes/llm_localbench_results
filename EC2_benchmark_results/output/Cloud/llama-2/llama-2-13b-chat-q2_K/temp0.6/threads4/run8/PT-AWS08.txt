An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B. Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume provides persistent storage that is ideal for mission-critical workloads. Attaching an EBS volume in the existing EC2 instance will provide a consistent and highly available storage solution.

Using Amazon S3 to store backup data is a good option as it provides a scalable and durable object storage service. Configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days will help in reducing the storage costs by moving infrequently accessed data to a more cost-effective storage class.

Option A is incorrect as instance store volumes are not persistent and are not suitable for mission-critical workloads. Option C is incorrect as Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a low-latency storage class that is not intended for long-term storage. Option D is incorrect as there is no option to attach an instance store volume in an existing EC2 instance.
