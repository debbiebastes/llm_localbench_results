The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

A) Deploy the OS patches using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, integrate with Kibana to record and track configuration changes.

Explanation: The best solution in this scenario is option A, deploying the OS patches using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. This approach provides a centralized management of the patch deployment process, ensures timely and consistent application of patches, and integrates well with Kibana for audit purposes.

Option B is not suitable because it does not address the need for centralized management and compliance tracking. Option C is also not suitable as it does not provide a comprehensive solution for patch deployment and configuration change management. Option D is not feasible as it does not provide timely and consistent application of patches.
