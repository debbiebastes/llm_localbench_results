A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation: When the traffic spikes, enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway helps to manage the sudden influx of requests without overwhelming the backend systems. Throttling limits control the number of requests that can be sent to the Lambda function within a specific period, while result caching stores frequently requested results in memory to reduce the load on the backend systems.

Option (A) switching to a more scalable architecture is not a solution for protecting against traffic spikes, as it may take time to deploy and configure the new infrastructure. Option (C) using CloudFront as a cache may help improve performance but will not address the issue of sudden traffic surges. Option (D) moving the Lambda function to a VPC may provide some security benefits, but it is not directly related to managing traffic spikes.
