A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:

To ensure that the sensitive PII data is never sent to AWS in unencrypted form, the Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption using a KMS-managed customer master key. This will ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the encrypted data, and any unauthorized access attempts will be prevented.

Option (A) is incorrect because it uses a client-side master key, which may not provide adequate security measures. Option (C) is incorrect because it uses a server-side encryption, which may not provide sufficient control over data access and encryption management. Option (D) is incorrect because customer-provided keys may not meet compliance requirements.
