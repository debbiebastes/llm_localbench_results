Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Explanation:
Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a way to communicate between microservices, allowing you to trigger actions based on events.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a fully managed message queue service, but it does not provide the same level of event-driven functionality as Amazon EventBridge.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a fully managed messaging service that sends messages or push notifications to subscribers, but it is not designed for decoupling components of an application architecture.

Amazon Kinesis is a fully managed streaming service that captures and processes large amounts of streaming data, but it does not provide the same level of event-driven functionality as Amazon EventBridge.
