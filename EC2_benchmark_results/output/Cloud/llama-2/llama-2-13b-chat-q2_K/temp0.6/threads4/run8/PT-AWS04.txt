Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

To achieve optimal performance, you should launch six EC2 instances.

Explanation:

When resharding your Kinesis data stream to increase the number of open shards, you need to ensure that each shard is assigned to a separate instance. This means that if you have six open shards, you will need six instances to process them optimally. Launching fewer instances may lead to performance issues due to increased workload on individual instances.
