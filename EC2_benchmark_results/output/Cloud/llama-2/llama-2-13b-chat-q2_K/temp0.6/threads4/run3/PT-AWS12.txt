A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B. No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation: 

The most cost-effective option would be to use the No Upfront, Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term because it offers the lowest hourly rate and no upfront costs. Although the All Upfront options may appear more cost-effective in the short term, they do not offer as much flexibility or long-term savings as the No Upfront option. Additionally, using a Reserved Instance for more than 3 years would provide further cost savings over time.
