The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.

Rationale: Setting up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy OS patches is the most suitable solution in this scenario as it allows for easy deployment of patches across multiple instances, while also providing a centralized management of patching activities. Using Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes provides additional auditing capabilities.

Option (A) using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager for recording changes is not the best choice here since it doesn't provide centralized patch management capabilities. Option (C) using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy OS patches is also not ideal, as it does not provide centralized management of patching activities. Option (D) configuring instances to automatically install patches on a weekly basis may be a good solution for maintaining compliance, but it doesn't address the immediate security risk and does not provide centralized management of patching activities.
