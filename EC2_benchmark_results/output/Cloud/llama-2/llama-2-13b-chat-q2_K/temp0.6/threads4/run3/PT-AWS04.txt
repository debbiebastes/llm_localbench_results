Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12.

When resharding your stream, each shard is processing one instance, so the total number of instances required to process all six shards would be 12 (6 x 2). This ensures optimal performance and utilization of resources.
