A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:

When traffic spikes, the API Gateway can become overwhelmed with requests, leading to performance issues and potentially causing the backend systems to become unresponsive. To protect the backend systems from traffic spikes, we should enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Throttling limits can help control the number of requests that are sent to the backend systems, preventing overloading and ensuring that the system remains stable under high traffic conditions. Result caching can also help reduce the load on the backend systems by storing frequently requested data in memory, which can improve the performance and scalability of the platform.

AWS Lambda and API Gateway are highly scalable and resilient services, but they may not be able to handle sudden spikes in traffic without proper configuration. Switching to EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling (Option A) can provide more scalability and availability, but it may not address the immediate need for traffic management during the expected surge. Using CloudFront in front of API Gateway (Option C) can help distribute the traffic load across multiple edge locations, but it would not directly address the issue of throttling limits and result caching.

Moving the Lambda function into a VPC (Option D) may provide additional security benefits, but it is not related to traffic management and scalability during high traffic conditions. Therefore, option B, enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway, is the best answer for protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes.
