A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 

Correct answer is C. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

Option A, Setting up DynamoDB Accelerator, is not related to compliance requirements for recording and storing new changes in another region.

Option D, Enabling DynamoDB Streams, would require setting up a separate stream for each table, which might not be the most efficient approach.

Option B, Enabling DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery, is not related to compliance requirements for recording and storing new changes in another region.

Option C, Creating an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements. This approach allows for real-time processing of new changes in one table and storing them in another table in another region, ensuring that all new changes are recorded and stored in a centralized manner.
