Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Explanation:

Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a highly scalable and reliable event bus that allows you to subscribe to events and handle them in real-time, without having to worry about the complexity of managing and routing events.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queue service that enables you to decouple the components of your application architecture, but it does not provide event subscriptions or real-time handling of events.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a messaging service that sends messages or push notifications to multiple subscribers or clients, but it does not provide event subscriptions or real-time handling of events.

Amazon Kinesis is a streaming service that enables you to collect, process, and analyze large amounts of streaming data in real-time, but it does not provide event subscriptions or decoupling of components.
