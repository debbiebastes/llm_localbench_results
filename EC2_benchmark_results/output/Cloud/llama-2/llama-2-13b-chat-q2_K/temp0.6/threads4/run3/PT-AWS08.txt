An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
B - Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

To meet the requirement of a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, option B is the best choice. An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume provides persistent block storage that is ideal for mission-critical workloads. Additionally, using Amazon S3 to store backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier ensures that the backup data is stored securely and efficiently.

Option A is not suitable because instance store volumes are not designed for long-term use and may not provide the necessary persistence for mission-critical workloads. Option C is also not suitable because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA does not support block storage, and using an EBS volume in conjunction with an object storage service would not meet the requirement of a persistent block storage volume. Finally, option D is incorrect because instance store volumes are not designed for long-term use and may not provide the necessary persistence for mission-critical workloads.
