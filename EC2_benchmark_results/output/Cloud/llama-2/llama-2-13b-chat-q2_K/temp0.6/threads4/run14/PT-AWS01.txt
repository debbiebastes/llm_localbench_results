A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation: To store sensitive PII data securely, the Security Engineer should implement Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key (option B). This approach ensures that the master keys are never sent to AWS and only the encrypted data is stored in the S3 bucket. The KMS-managed customer master key can be created and managed within the company's infrastructure, providing an additional layer of control and security over the encryption process.
