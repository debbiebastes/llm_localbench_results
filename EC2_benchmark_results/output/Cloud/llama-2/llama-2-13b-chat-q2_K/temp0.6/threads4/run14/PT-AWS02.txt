The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes. 

Explanation: Of the given options, A is the most suitable solution in this scenario. This option allows for the quick deployment of OS patches to all outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. It also integrates Amazon QuickSight with Kibana for easy tracking and recording of any configuration changes made during the patching process. The use of AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager ensures that all EC2 instances are updated with the latest security patches, thus mitigating security risks. Additionally, using Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes provides a centralized audit trail for compliance purposes. 

Note: While option D is also a valid solution, it may not be feasible in this scenario since the EC2 instances are already outdated and need immediate patching.
