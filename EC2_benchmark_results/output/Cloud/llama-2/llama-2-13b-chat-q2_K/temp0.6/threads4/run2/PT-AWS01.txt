A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Rationale: The best approach to ensure compliance with strict regulations and avoid sending sensitive data to AWS is to use a KMS-managed customer master key for encryption. This ensures that the master key is never sent to AWS, and only the encrypted data is stored in S3, while maintaining control of the encryption process.
