Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

B) 12

Explanation:

When the number of open shards is increased from four to six, each instance will be responsible for processing two shards instead of one. This means that each instance will have double the amount of data to process.

Since KCL workers are single-threaded and each worker can only process one shard at a time, the maximum number of EC2 instances that should be launched is 12 (i.e., 6 shards x 2 instances per shard). This will ensure that each instance has an optimal amount of work to do and will improve overall application performance.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B) 12.
