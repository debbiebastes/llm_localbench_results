Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 

(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Explanation:
Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a highly scalable and resilient infrastructure for handling events, allowing you to focus on building your application logic without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service), Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service), and Amazon Kinesis are also event-driven services, but they are more focused on messaging and data streaming, respectively, rather than providing a general-purpose event bus like EventBridge.
