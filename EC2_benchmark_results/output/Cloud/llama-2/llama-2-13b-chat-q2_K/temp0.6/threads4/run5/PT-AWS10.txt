An e-commerce company wants to migrate its on-premise infrastructure to Amazon Web Services. However, they are worried about ensuring their migration is secure and efficient.

Which of the following AWS Cloud Adoption Framework perspective would be the most essential for the companyâ€™s migration?

(A) Security Perspective
(B) Governance Perspective
(C) Operations Perspective
(D) Platform Perspective

Answer: 

(A) Security Perspective.

When migrating to the cloud, security is a top concern for companies, and the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework emphasizes that enterprises should prioritize their security requirements when transitioning to AWS.

This includes implementing robust identity and access management (IAM), encrypting data in transit and at rest, and adhering to best practices such as least privilege access, network segmentation, and regular security assessments and penetration testing.

By prioritizing the Security Perspective, the company can ensure that its migration to AWS is not only efficient but also secure.
