The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

The most suitable solution in this scenario is Option (A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.

The solution involves deploying patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, which provides a centralized and automated way to manage patches across multiple instances. Additionally, integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana allows for real-time monitoring and tracking of configuration changes, providing an audit trail of all changes made to the environment.

Option (B) setting up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems is not the most suitable solution as it does not address the need for real-time monitoring and tracking of configuration changes.

Option (C) using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances, sets up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes is also not the most suitable solution, as it does not address the need for real-time monitoring and tracking of configuration changes.

Option (D) configuring the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis is not the most suitable solution, as it does not provide real-time monitoring and tracking of configuration changes.
