A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
(A)

Explanation:

The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is to use AWS Config rules to detect and remediate the security groups that allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. This approach allows for automated detection and remediation of the security risk, without the need for manual intervention or custom scripts.

Option (B) setting up a Transit VPC is not directly related to remediating the security risk, as it only provides a way to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances, but does not address the specific security risk at hand.

Option (C) blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL is one way to mitigate the risk, but it may not be the most efficient approach as it requires manual configuration and ongoing maintenance to keep the list of blocked IP addresses up to date.

Option (D) using AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is a valuable feature, but it does not provide an efficient way to remediate the specific security risk at hand.
