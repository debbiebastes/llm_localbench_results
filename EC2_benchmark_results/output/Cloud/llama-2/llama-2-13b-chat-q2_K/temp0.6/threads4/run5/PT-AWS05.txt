A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

Option A is not ideal because it requires manual intervention from the developer to set up and maintain the DynamoDB Accelerator.

Option B is not ideal because Point-in-Time Recovery is meant for disaster recovery and not for tracking changes in real-time.

Option D is not ideal because it requires additional infrastructure setup and maintenance of DynamoDB Streams.

Option C is the most ideal solution as it utilizes Amazon EventBridge, a fully managed service that provides a low-latency stream of events from DynamoDB, allowing for real-time processing of new changes in the source table. Additionally, using a Lambda function as the rule target allows for serverless execution of the processing logic.
