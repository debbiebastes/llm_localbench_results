A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.

Explanation: CloudFront can be used to distribute traffic to multiple origins, including API Gateway. By caching frequently requested content, such as static assets and API results, CloudFront can help reduce the load on the backend systems and protect against traffic spikes. Additionally, CloudFront's global network of edge locations can help reduce latency and improve performance for users around the world.
