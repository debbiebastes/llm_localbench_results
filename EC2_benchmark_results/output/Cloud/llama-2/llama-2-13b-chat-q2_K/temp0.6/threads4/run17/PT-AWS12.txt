(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:

The cost-effective option would be to go with (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option offers the lowest total cost of ownership, as there is no upfront payment required, and the instance type can be converted to other types as needed without any additional fees. The 3-year term also provides long-term predictability and stability in costs.

Option (A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term is more expensive than option (B), but it offers more flexibility in case the application needs to be scaled up or down within a year.

Option (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term is also more expensive than option (B), and it requires an upfront payment, which might not be feasible for some businesses.

Option (D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year is the most flexible option, but it also has the highest total cost of ownership due to the repeated upfront payments and potential for higher costs over time.
