A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:

To ensure that the sensitive PII of patients is protected, the Security Engineer should implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This will allow the hospital to maintain control over the encryption and decryption processes, while also ensuring that the data remains secure in transit and at rest.

Option A is not suitable because it would require the hospital to store the master keys on AWS, which is not compliant with regulatory requirements. Option C is not suitable because it would require the hospital to manage the encryption and decryption processes, which could be complex and resource-intensive. Option D is not suitable because it would allow the hospital to use a customer-provided key, but this may not meet compliance requirements.
