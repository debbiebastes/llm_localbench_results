Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

B. 12

Rationale: Each instance can process one shard, so with six open shards, you need six instances to achieve optimum performance. Since each instance has one KCL worker, launching 12 instances would result in doubling the number of workers, which is not optimal as it will lead to duplicated effort and reduced efficiency.

Note: The correct answer is B. 12.
