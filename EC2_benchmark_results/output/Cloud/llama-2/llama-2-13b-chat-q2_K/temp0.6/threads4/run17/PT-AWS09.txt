A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:

API Gateway is responsible for handling incoming requests from clients, and it can be configured to enforce throttling limits and cache results. This helps protect the backend systems from traffic spikes by controlling the rate of incoming requests and reducing the number of requests that need to be processed.

Option (A) is incorrect because EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling are not specifically designed to handle sudden traffic spikes. Option (C) is incorrect because CloudFront is not a solution for protecting backend systems from traffic spikes. Option (D) is incorrect because moving the Lambda function to a VPC does not directly address the issue of traffic spikes.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (B), which involves enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway to protect the backend systems from traffic spikes.
