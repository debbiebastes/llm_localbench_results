A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Rationale: A 502 Bad Gateway error typically indicates that there is an issue with the proxy server or the integration between the proxy server and the backend service. In this case, the developer received a properly formatted XML result from the underlying function, indicating that the problem is likely with the API Gateway proxy integration rather than the Lambda function itself. Option (A) states that there is an incompatible output returned from the Lambda proxy integration backend, which aligns with this scenario.
