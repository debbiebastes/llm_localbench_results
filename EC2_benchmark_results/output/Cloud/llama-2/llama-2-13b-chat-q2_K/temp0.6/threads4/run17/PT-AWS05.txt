A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

* Option A is not ideal because it requires setting up an additional service (DynamoDB Accelerator) when the existing infrastructure should be sufficient for compliance.
* Option B is not ideal because Point-in-Time Recovery is a disaster recovery feature and may not be suitable for tracking new changes.
* Option D is not ideal because DynamoDB Streams are designed for real-time data processing, which may not be necessary in this scenario.

Option C is the most ideal approach as it leverages Amazon EventBridge to track table-level events in DynamoDB and process new changes with a Lambda function. This approach is efficient, scalable, and does not require additional infrastructure setup.
