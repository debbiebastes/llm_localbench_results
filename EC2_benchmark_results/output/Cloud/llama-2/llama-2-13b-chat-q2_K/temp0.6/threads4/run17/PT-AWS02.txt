The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:

In this scenario, the most suitable solution is option C, which involves using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. This approach is recommended because it allows for easy deployment of patches, and integration with AWS Config enables recording and tracking of configuration changes for audit purposes.

Option A is not suitable because it only provides a temporary solution and does not address the underlying issue of outdated operating systems. Option B requires additional setup and maintenance, and may not be able to track compliance status in real-time. Option D is not a viable solution as it does not provide immediate mitigation of security risks and may not be able to track compliance status effectively.

Therefore, option C is the most suitable solution for this scenario.
