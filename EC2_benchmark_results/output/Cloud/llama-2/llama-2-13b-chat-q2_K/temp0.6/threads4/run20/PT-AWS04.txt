Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(B) 12

Explanation: With six shards and one KCL worker per instance, you need at least six instances to ensure that each shard has a dedicated worker. However, having more than one worker per shard can lead to increased processing time and reduced throughput due to the added overhead of context switching between workers. Therefore, launching 12 EC2 instances (two per shard) is optimum for your application's performance.
