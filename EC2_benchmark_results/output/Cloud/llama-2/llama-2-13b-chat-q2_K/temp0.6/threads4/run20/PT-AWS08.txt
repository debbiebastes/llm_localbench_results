An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B. Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation: To meet the requirement for a persistent block storage volume, option B is the best choice. Attaching an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume to your EC2 instance will provide a reliable and durable storage solution that can be used for mission-critical workloads. Additionally, using Amazon S3 to store backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier will provide a cost-effective and scalable storage solution.

Option A is not a good choice because instance store volumes are not designed for long-term storage and may not be reliable or durable enough for mission-critical workloads. Option C is also not a good choice because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA does not provide the same level of durability and availability as EBS volumes. Option D is incorrect because instance store volumes are not designed for long-term storage and may not be reliable or durable enough for mission-critical workloads.
