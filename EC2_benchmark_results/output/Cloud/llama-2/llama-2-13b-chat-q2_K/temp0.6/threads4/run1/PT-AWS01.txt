A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 

Explanation: To ensure that the sensitive PII data is never sent to AWS, the Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption using a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach ensures that the data remains encrypted even when it's being transmitted from the hospital's application to the S3 bucket. The KMS-managed customer master key will be stored securely on the hospital's premises, and will never be sent to AWS.

Amazon S3 provides client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key, which can be used to encrypt data before it's uploaded to the S3 bucket. This approach ensures that the data remains encrypted while it's being stored in the S3 bucket, and it also prevents unauthorized access to the data.

Option (A) is incorrect because it involves using a client-side master key, which may not be as secure as using a KMS-managed key. Option (C) is incorrect because it involves server-side encryption, which may not provide the same level of security as client-side encryption. Option (D) is incorrect because it involves using a customer-provided key, which may not be as secure as using a KMS-managed key.
