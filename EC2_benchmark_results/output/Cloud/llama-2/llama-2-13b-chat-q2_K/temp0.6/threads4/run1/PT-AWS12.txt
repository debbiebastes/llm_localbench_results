A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Rationale:

* Option B provides the lowest upfront cost and the longest commitment period (3 years).
* The convertible feature allows the instance to be upgraded or downgraded as needed, providing flexibility and potential cost savings over the long term.
* As the application will be used for more than 3 years, committing to a 3-year term with no upfront cost offers the most cost-effective solution.
