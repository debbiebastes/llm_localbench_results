A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.

Explanation: A transit VPC is a highly efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk because it allows the company to route all traffic from the EC2 instances through the corporate firewall, thereby enforcing security policies and protecting against unauthorized access. With a transit VPC, the company can easily identify and block any malicious traffic coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Option A is not efficient because it relies on manual detection and remediation, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Option C is not effective because it only blocks specific source IP addresses and does not provide a comprehensive solution for all traffic coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Option D is also not effective as AWS Shield only provides limited protection against certain types of attacks, and does not address the issue of unauthorized access from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.
