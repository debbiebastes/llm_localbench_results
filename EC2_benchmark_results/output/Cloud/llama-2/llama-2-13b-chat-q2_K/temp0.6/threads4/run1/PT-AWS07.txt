A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances.

Explanation: A predictive scaling policy uses historical data and machine learning algorithms to forecast future usage and scale the resources accordingly. This solution is the most operationally efficient because it allows the system to proactively scale based on expected usage, rather than reacting to current conditions.

Option (B) Dynamic scaling based on Memory utilization may not be the most effective approach as memory usage may not always be a good indicator of future usage.

Option (C) Scheduled scaling based on the start of the day may not be necessary as the application is already experiencing slow performance during the start of the day.

Option (D) Dynamic scaling based on CPU utilization may also not be the most effective approach as CPU usage may not always be a good indicator of future usage.
