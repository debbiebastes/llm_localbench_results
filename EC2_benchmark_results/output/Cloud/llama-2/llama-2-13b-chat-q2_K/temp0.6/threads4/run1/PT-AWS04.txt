Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

B) 12

Explanation:

With six open shards and one KCL worker per instance, there is a need for 6 workers to process the data stream optimally. Launching 12 EC2 instances will ensure that each shard has two workers processing it, leading to better performance and scalability.
