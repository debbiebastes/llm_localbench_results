A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

Option A is not ideal because it doesn't provide real-time data replication, and may cause performance issues.

Option B is not ideal because it requires manual setup and management of Point-in-Time Recovery, which can be error-prone and require a lot of maintenance.

Option D is not ideal because it requires manual configuration and management of DynamoDB Streams, which can be complex and resource-intensive.

Option C provides real-time data replication and automatic processing of new changes in the DynamoDB table. The Amazon EventBridge rule triggers the Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table, ensuring compliance with the company's IT requirements.
