A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation: A 502 Bad Gateway error typically indicates that there is an issue with the backend server, specifically that the server does not support the HTTP status code being returned. In this case, the developer has mentioned that the underlying function properly returned the result in XML format, indicating that the output from the Lambda function is likely incompatible with the API Gateway's expected output format. Therefore, option (A) is the most likely root cause of the issue.
