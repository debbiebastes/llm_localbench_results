An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume is the best storage option for mission-critical workloads as it provides persistent storage that is attached to an EC2 instance. Attaching an EBS volume to an EC2 instance ensures that the data is persisted even in case of a system failure or instance termination.

Using Amazon S3 to store backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier provides a cost-effective storage solution for long-term data retention. Amazon S3 Glacier provides low-cost archival storage for infrequently accessed data.

Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not persistent and should not be used for mission-critical workloads. Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA does not provide the same level of persistence as EBS volumes. Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not the best storage option for mission-critical workloads.
