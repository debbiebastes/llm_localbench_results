A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation: 
The most cost-effective option would be to choose the No Upfront, Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option offers the lowest hourly rate and provides the flexibility to convert to On-Demand instances as needed, which can help save on costs over the long term.

Option (A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term has a higher hourly rate than No Upfront option and requires a higher upfront payment. Option (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term has an even higher hourly rate and requires a larger upfront payment. Option (D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year may provide some cost savings over the short term but would not be as cost-effective in the long run due to the higher hourly rate and the need for repeated upgrades.
