A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation: A Bad Gateway error (502) typically indicates that there is a problem with the backend server or service, rather than the client's request. In this case, the developer received the 502 status code when calling the MyAPI endpoint, indicating that there is an issue with the Lambda function integration as the proxy backend. One possible cause of this issue could be incompatible output returned from the Lambda function integration.
