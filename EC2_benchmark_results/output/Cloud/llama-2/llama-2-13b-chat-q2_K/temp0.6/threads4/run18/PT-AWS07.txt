A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances.

Rationale: Predictive scaling policies can analyze historical data and forecast future usage patterns to automatically adjust the number of instances in the Auto Scaling group, ensuring that there are enough resources available at the start of the day when the application is heavily used. This approach is more operationally efficient than the other options because it doesn't require manual intervention or over-provisioning of instances.

Note: The question states that the application is extensively used during office hours, so it's important to ensure that there are enough resources available during those times to avoid performance issues.
