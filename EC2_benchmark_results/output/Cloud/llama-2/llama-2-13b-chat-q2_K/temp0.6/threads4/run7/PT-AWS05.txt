A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

* Option A, DynamoDB Accelerator, is not relevant in this scenario as it only speeds up data retrieval from DynamoDB and does not provide any data protection or backup capabilities.
* Option B, DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery, can be used to create a backup of the DynamoDB table, but it does not provide real-time data tracking or compliance recording.
* Option D, DynamoDB Streams, is also not ideal as it only provides a stream of changes and does not provide real-time data tracking or compliance recording.

Option C, creating an Amazon EventBridge rule, is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements. This solution allows for real-time tracking of new changes made to the DynamoDB table, and the Lambda function can be set up to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach ensures that all new changes are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region, thereby fulfilling the IT compliance requirements.
