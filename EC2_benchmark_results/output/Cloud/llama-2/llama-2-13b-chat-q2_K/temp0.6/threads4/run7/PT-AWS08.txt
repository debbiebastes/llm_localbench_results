An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B. Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

The requirement for a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads can be met by attaching an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume in the existing EC2 instance. This will provide a reliable and high-performance storage solution that is well-suited for mission-critical workloads.

The backup data should be stored in Amazon S3, which provides a highly durable and scalable object storage service. To ensure long-term retention of the backup data, a lifecycle policy can be configured to transition the objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. This will provide a cost-effective and efficient storage solution for the backup data.

Therefore, option B is the best choice for meeting the given requirement.
