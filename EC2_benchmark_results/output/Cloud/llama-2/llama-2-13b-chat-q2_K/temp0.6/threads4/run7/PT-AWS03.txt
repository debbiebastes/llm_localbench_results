A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

A) Using AWS Config rules to automatically detect and remediate security group settings is a highly efficient way to address this security risk, as it can help prevent unauthorized inbound traffic from unknown sources. The association of Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function will ensure that the security group updates are applied consistently across all instances. However, using Transit VPC or Network ACL to block source IP addresses may not be effective in this case, as it would also block legitimate traffic from known sources. Similarly, while AWS Shield can detect and monitor security groups, it may not be able to automatically remediate the issue without additional configuration and integration with other security tools.
