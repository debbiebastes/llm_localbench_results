A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation: A 502 Bad Gateway error typically indicates that the request timed out or that there was an incompatible output from the upstream server, which in this case is the Lambda function. Since the developer was able to properly return the result in XML format when invoking the underlying function, it is likely that the issue lies with the integration between the API Gateway and the Lambda function.
