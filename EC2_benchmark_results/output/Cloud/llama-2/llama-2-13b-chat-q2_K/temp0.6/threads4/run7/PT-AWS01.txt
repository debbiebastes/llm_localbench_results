A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation: To ensure that sensitive PII of patients is protected, the Security Engineer should implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key (Option B). This approach will allow for secure storage and transmission of the data while maintaining control over the keys within the company. The KMS-managed customer master key will ensure that only authorized parties can access the encrypted data, providing an additional layer of security.
