Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12

Explanation: The formula for calculating the number of KCL workers required is = (Total Shards x Worker Size). In this scenario, total shards are six, and worker size is one. Therefore, to achieve optimum performance, we need at least twelve EC2 instances (6 x 1).
