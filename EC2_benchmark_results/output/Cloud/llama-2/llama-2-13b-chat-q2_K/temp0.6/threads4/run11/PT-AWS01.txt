A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation: To comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company, the Security Engineer should implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This will ensure that the sensitive PII data is encrypted at the client-side, and the unencrypted data will never be sent to AWS.

Option (A) is incorrect because it involves using a client-side master key, which may not meet compliance requirements. Option (C) is incorrect because it involves using a server-side encryption, which may not provide adequate security for sensitive PII data. Option (D) is incorrect because it involves using a customer-provided key, which may not be secure or compliant with regulations.

Therefore, option (B) is the best answer.
