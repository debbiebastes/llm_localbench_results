The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation: In this scenario, the most suitable solution is to deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. This approach ensures that all instances are patched promptly, minimizing the risk of security breaches. Integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana allows for efficient tracking and recording of configuration changes, providing valuable audit data for compliance purposes.

Option (B) is incorrect because it does not address the immediate need to mitigate the security risk. Option (C) is also incorrect since it only provides a solution for easy patch deployment but does not include recording and tracking of configuration changes. Option (D) is not a suitable solution as automatic installation of OS patches on a weekly basis may not be sufficient to address immediate security risks.
