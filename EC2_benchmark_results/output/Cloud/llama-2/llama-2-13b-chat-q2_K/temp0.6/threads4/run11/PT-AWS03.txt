A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:
The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is to use AWS Config rules to detect and remediate any security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. This can be done by associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule. This will automatically update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address, effectively blocking any unauthorized traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

The other options do not address the issue as effectively:

B) Setting up a Transit VPC would not directly address the issue of unauthorized traffic coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

C) Blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACLs would only block traffic from known sources, but it would not address the issue of unknown or unrecognized sources that may be attempting to access the network.

D) Using AWS Shield to monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range would provide some level of protection, but it would not automatically remediate the issue or update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
