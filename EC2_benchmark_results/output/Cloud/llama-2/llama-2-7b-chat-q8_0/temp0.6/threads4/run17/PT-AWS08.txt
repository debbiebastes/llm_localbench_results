An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.

Reasoning:

* An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads, which means it must be stored on an EBS volume instead of an instance store volume.
* Backup data will be stored in Amazon S3, and after 30 days, the data will be transitioned to a data archiving storage service, which can be done using a lifecycle policy in Amazon S3.
* Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are ephemeral and cannot be used for mission-critical workloads.
* Option (C) is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a suitable storage service for mission-critical workloads, as it does not provide the same level of durability and availability as EBS volumes.
* Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are ephemeral and cannot be used for mission-critical workloads.
