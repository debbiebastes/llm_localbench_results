A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day would be (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day. This will allow you to launch additional instances in advance, giving the application more resources to handle the increased load during the morning rush hour.
Configuring a Scheduled scaling policy allows you to specify a schedule for when new instances should be launched and how many instances should be running at each time. By setting the schedule to launch new instances before the start of the day, you can ensure that the application has enough resources to handle the increased load during the morning rush hour.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy is not the best option as it relies on historical data to predict future usage patterns, which may not always be accurate. Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy based on Memory utilization may not be effective in addressing the performance issue during the morning rush hour as memory usage may not be the only factor affecting application performance. Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy based on CPU utilization may also not be effective as CPU usage may not necessarily indicate when the application will experience performance issues.
