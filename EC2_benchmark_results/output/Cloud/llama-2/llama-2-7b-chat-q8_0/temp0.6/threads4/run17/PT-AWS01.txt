A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
Explanation:
The Security Engineer should implement Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key to ensure that the sensitive PII of patients is encrypted at rest and in transit, complying with the company's strict compliance and regulatory requirements. Client-side encryption means that the encryption keys are managed by the application or service, rather than AWS KMS, which ensures that the master keys never leave the hospital's premises.
Option (A) is incorrect because client-side encryption requires a customer-managed master key, which violates the company's policy of not sending sensitive data to AWS. Option (C) is also incorrect because server-side encryption involves storing the decryption keys on AWS servers, which poses a significant security risk. Option (D) is not a valid option as it requires customer-provided keys, which is also against the company's policy.
