Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

The optimal number of EC2 instances will depend on various factors such as the type and volume of data being processed, network latency, and resource utilization. However, based on the scenario provided, we can estimate the maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched to achieve optimum performance.
Since you have resharded your stream to increase the number of open shards from 4 to 6, it means that each instance is now processing a portion of the data in parallel. To utilize this additional capacity, we need to launch at least 6 EC2 instances.
Launching more than 6 instances may not provide any significant performance improvement, as the additional instances will have to contend with increased network latency and resource competition. On the other hand, launching fewer than 6 instances may result in bottlenecks and reduced processing capacity.
Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched to achieve optimum performance is 6.
Option (D) is the correct answer.
