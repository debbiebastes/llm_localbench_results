A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements is (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach provides several benefits:

1. **Decoupling**: By using EventBridge, you decouple the change data from the original table and pass it to a separate Lambda function for processing, reducing potential bottlenecks or issues in the original table.
2. **Asynchronous processing**: Using a Lambda function as a rule target allows for asynchronous processing of changes, ensuring that your application remains responsive and available even during the processing of large amounts of data.
3. **Cost-effective**: EventBridge is a cost-effective way to handle change data from DynamoDB, as you only pay for the resources used when events are processed. Compared to other options like DynamoDB Accelerator or Point-in-Time Recovery, this approach can help reduce costs by avoiding unnecessary capacity provisioning.
4. **Multi-region support**: By using EventBridge, you can easily set up a rule in one region and have it trigger a Lambda function in another region, ensuring compliance with the company's IT compliance requirements.

Therefore, option (C) is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements in this scenario.
