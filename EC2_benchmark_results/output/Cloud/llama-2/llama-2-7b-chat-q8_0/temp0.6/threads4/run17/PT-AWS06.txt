A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The most likely root cause of this issue is (B): The endpoint request timed-out. This error indicates that the API Gateway was unable to process the request within the configured time limit, typically 30 seconds. When a Lambda function is invoked through an API Gateway proxy integration, the underlying function may take longer than expected to complete, leading to a timeout and the resulting 502 Bad Gateway error.
Option (A) is incorrect because there is no incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend. Option (C) is also incorrect because occasional out-of-order invocations due to heavy loads are unlikely to result in a 502 Bad Gateway error specifically. Option (D) is not relevant to the issue described in the question.
