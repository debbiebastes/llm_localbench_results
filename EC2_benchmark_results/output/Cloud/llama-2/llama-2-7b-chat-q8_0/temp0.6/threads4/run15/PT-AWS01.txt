A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): "Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key."
Explanation:
In this scenario, the Security Engineer needs to ensure that the sensitive PII data stored in the AWS S3 bucket is encrypted at rest. However, since the master keys should never be sent to AWS, client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key is the best option. This approach allows the Security Engineer to manage their own master key securely outside of AWS and encrypt data using that key when it's uploaded to S3.
Option (A) would not meet the requirement of not sending the master keys to AWS, as the client-side encryption with a client-side master key would require the Security Engineer to store the master key in AWS. Option (C) is also not viable, as server-side encryption with a customer-provided key would require the Security Engineer to provide their own encryption key to AWS, which is not secure. Option (D) is incorrect as KMS managed key is managed by AWS and not by the customer.
