A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The best answer is (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
This approach provides the following benefits:
1. Leverages existing infrastructure: You can use your existing EventBridge and Lambda resources, which may have already been provisioned for other purposes.
2. Decouples DynamoDB changes from the application: By using EventBridge to track table-level events, you can separate the change tracking logic from the application code, making it easier to maintain and scale.
3. Achieves compliance: You can configure your Lambda function to save new changes to the other table in another region, ensuring that all changes are recorded and stored as required by IT compliance.
4. Scalable and fault-tolerant: By using a serverless architecture, you can easily scale your change tracking logic horizontally without worrying about capacity planning or maintenance.
5. Reduces operational overhead: With EventBridge handling the event tracking, you can reduce the operational overhead of maintaining and updating your application code to track changes in DynamoDB.
Therefore, option (C) is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements in this scenario.
