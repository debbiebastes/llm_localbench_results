A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B): The endpoint request timed-out.

When a Lambda function is invoked through an API Gateway proxy integration, the Lambda function has a time limit for processing each request. If the function takes longer than the allowed time to complete, it will return a 502 Bad Gateway error. This error indicates that the server did not receive a timely response from the Lambda function.
In this case, since the developer received a 502 Bad Gateway error when invoking the underlying Lambda function, it is likely that the request timed out while waiting for the Lambda function to complete.

The other options are not the root cause of the issue:
(A) Incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend: The developer mentioned that the underlying function properly returned the result in XML format, which suggests that the output is valid.

(C) Occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads: This option does not seem relevant since there is no mention of any performance issues or load on the system.

(D) Invalid API name of Amazon API Gateway proxy: The developer mentioned that she tried invoking the underlying function, which suggests that the API name is valid.
