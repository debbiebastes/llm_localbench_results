The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
In this scenario, the IT Security team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk by deploying the OS patches for the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The best solution is to use AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager to quickly deploy the patches to multiple instances simultaneously. This will minimize the time and resources required to complete the deployment process.
Additionally, integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana will enable the team to record and track any configuration changes made to the patched EC2 instances. This will provide a comprehensive audit trail for compliance purposes.
Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. However, this may take more time and resources compared to using Sessions Manager. Option (C) uses AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances, but does not provide a comprehensive audit trail for compliance purposes. Option (D) configures the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis, which may not be feasible in this scenario as the vulnerability needs to be addressed immediately.
