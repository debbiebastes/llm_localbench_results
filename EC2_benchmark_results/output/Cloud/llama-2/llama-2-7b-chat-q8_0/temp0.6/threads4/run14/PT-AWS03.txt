A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The most efficient way to automate remediation of this security risk is option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect and update security groups. Here's why:
Option (A) uses AWS Config, a service that allows you to manage AWS resources such as security groups, EC2 instances, and VPCs. By setting up an AWS Config rule, you can automatically detect any security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which is the source of the security risk.
Once the security group is detected, you can associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This will ensure that only authorized traffic from the corporate firewall is allowed into the EC2 instances, thereby mitigating the security risk.
Options (B), (C), and (D) do not provide an efficient solution for automated remediation of this security risk:
Option (B) involves setting up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances, which can be complex and time-consuming. It may also require additional infrastructure and configuration.
Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, but this does not automatically remediate the security group issue. You would still need to update the security group rules manually, which can be error-prone and time-consuming.
Option (D) uses AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but it does not provide an automatic remediation solution like Option (A). You would still need to update the security group rules manually, which can be error-prone and time-consuming.
In summary, option (A) is the most efficient way to automate remediation of this security risk because it uses AWS Config rules to detect and update security groups automatically, reducing the likelihood of errors and improving the speed of remediation.
