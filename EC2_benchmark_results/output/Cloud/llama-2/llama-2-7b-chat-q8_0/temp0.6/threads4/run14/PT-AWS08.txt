An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.

Explanation:

For mission-critical workloads, it's important to have a persistent block storage volume that is separate from the instance store volume. An EBS volume provides a block-level storage device that is attached to an EC2 instance and provides persistence of data even if the instance crashes or is terminated.
To meet the requirement of storing backup data in an object storage service after 30 days, you can use Amazon S3. You can attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance and then use Amazon S3 to store your backup data. After 30 days, you can configure a lifecycle policy in Amazon S3 to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier or Amazon S3 One Zone-IA, depending on your storage requirements.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads and do not provide persistent storage. Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a data archiving service that is optimized for infrequently accessed data, whereas you need a storage service that provides both hot and cold storage tiers.
Therefore, the best answer is to attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance and use Amazon S3 to store your backup data.
