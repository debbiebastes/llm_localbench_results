Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation:
When resharding your Kinesis stream, you increase the number of open shards from four to six. This means that each instance will handle one-third of the data volume, which is a more even distribution than before. To achieve optimum performance, you should launch a maximum of six EC2 instances to match the resharded number of open shards. Launching more than six instances will not provide any additional performance benefits and will only increase your costs. Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch is six.
