A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
When you configure a Lambda function as a backend for an API Gateway proxy, the function must return a response that is compatible with the HTTP status code and content type expected by the API Gateway. If the function returns a response with an unexpected status code or content type, it can cause the API Gateway to return a 502 Bad Gateway error to the caller. In this case, since the developer mentioned that the underlying function properly returned the result in XML format, it is likely that the issue is due to an incompatible output from the Lambda function.
