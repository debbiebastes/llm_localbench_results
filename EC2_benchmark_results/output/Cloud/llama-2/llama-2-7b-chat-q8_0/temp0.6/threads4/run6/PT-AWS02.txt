The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is option (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Here's why:
Option A uses AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, which provides a simple and scalable way to manage the patching process across multiple EC2 instances. It also integrates with Amazon QuickSight, which can be used to create custom dashboards and visualizations to track compliance and configuration changes over time. This solution is the most efficient and effective way to mitigate the security risk posed by the outdated operating systems in a timely manner.
Option B (Setting up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager) is a viable alternative, but it may not be as flexible or scalable as option A, especially if there are many EC2 instances that need patching. Option C (Using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager and AWS Config) is also an option, but it may require more configuration and setup than option A.
Option D (Configuring Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install OS patches on a weekly basis) may be a viable solution in the long term, but it may not be as effective in mitigating the immediate security risk posed by the outdated operating systems.
