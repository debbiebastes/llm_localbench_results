An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.
Explanation:

To meet the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, you should use an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume in your EC2 instance. EBS provides high-performance, durable block storage that is ideal for mission-critical applications.
To store the backup data, you can use Amazon S3, which provides a highly scalable and durable object storage service. You can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which will provide long-term archiving at a lower cost.
Option (A) is not the best choice because instance store volumes are designed for use in instances that are running and do not provide the same level of durability as EBS volumes.
Option (C) is also not the best choice because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a storage service that provides low-latency access to data in a single Availability Zone, but it does not provide the same level of durability as EBS or Amazon S3 Glacier.
Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are designed for use in instances that are running and do not provide the same level of durability as EBS volumes.
