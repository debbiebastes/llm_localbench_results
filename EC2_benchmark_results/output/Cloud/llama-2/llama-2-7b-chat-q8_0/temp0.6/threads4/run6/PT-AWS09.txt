A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
The best answer is (B): Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
API Gateway provides a feature called "throttling" that allows you to limit the number of requests that can be made to your backend API within a certain time period. This can help prevent the backend system from being overwhelmed with too many requests during a traffic spike.
You can also enable caching in API Gateway to store frequently requested data, such as API responses, in memory or in an S3 bucket. This can reduce the load on the backend system and improve response times for repeat requests.
Option (A) is incorrect because while EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling can provide more scalability and availability, they are not necessary for protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes.
Option (C) is also incorrect because CloudFront is a content delivery network that can help reduce the latency of API responses by caching them closer to the end-users, but it does not provide any protection against traffic spikes.
Option (D) is incorrect because moving a Lambda function to a VPC can actually decrease its availability and scalability during a traffic spike, since the VPC may not be able to handle the increased load as efficiently as an outside-VPC architecture.
