A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Explanation:
Option (A) is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk because it uses AWS Config, which is a highly scalable and reliable service for managing resources across multiple AWS accounts. By using AWS Config, you can easily monitor and manage security groups across your AWS environment, and automatically detect any rules that allow inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.
Option (B) is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because it involves setting up a Transit VPC, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Additionally, it may not provide real-time detection of security risks.
Option (C) is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because it involves blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL. While this can help prevent unauthorized access to your resources, it may not be able to detect and remediate security risks in real-time.
Option (D) is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because AWS Shield is a service that provides DDoS protection, but it does not provide real-time detection of security risks in security groups.
