Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The answer is (D) 6.

Explanation: When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards must be a power of 2. In this case, resharding from four shards to six shards means that each instance will have two KCL workers, one for each shard. This is the optimum configuration to achieve maximum performance. Launching more than six instances will not provide any additional performance benefits and may increase costs without providing a proportional increase in processing capacity.
