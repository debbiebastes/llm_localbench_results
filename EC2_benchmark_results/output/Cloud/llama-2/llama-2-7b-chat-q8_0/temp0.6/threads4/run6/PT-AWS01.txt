A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The Security Engineer should implement (B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.
Explanation:
To meet the requirement of not sending sensitive PII to AWS, the Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption using a KMS-managed customer master key. This way, the master key will be managed by the customer and not by AWS, ensuring that it remains within the control of the organization at all times.
Option (A) is incorrect because client-side encryption with a client-side master key would mean that the master key is stored in the application, which goes against the requirement of not sending sensitive PII to AWS.
Option (C) is also incorrect because server-side encryption uses a key managed by AWS, which violates the compliance and regulatory requirements of the company.
Option (D) is irrelevant as it does not provide any advantage over client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key in terms of meeting the requirement of keeping sensitive PII within the organization's control.
