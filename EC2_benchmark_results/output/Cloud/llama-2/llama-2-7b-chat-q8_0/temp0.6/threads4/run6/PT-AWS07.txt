A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The most operationally efficient solution would be (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation:
The issue at hand is that the application is slow during the start of the day, and this can be attributed to insufficient instance capacity or high CPU/Memory utilization. To address this, a Scheduled scaling policy can be configured to launch new instances before the start of the day. This will ensure that there are sufficient instances available at the beginning of the day to handle the increased workload, thereby improving performance.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy is not the most operationally efficient solution as it relies on machine learning algorithms to predict future resource utilization, which can be unpredictable and may not always accurately forecast the actual usage.
Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy based on Memory utilization will not address the issue of slow performance during the start of the day. While dynamic scaling can adjust instance capacity based on current usage, it does not provide any additional instances beforehand to handle the increased workload at the beginning of the day.
Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy based on CPU utilization is also not the most operationally efficient solution as it may lead to over-provisioning of instances during periods of low CPU usage, resulting in wasted resources.
