A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B): The endpoint request timed-out.
When a Lambda function is invoked through an API Gateway proxy integration, the underlying function has a limited amount of time to complete its execution before the API Gateway times out and returns a 502 Bad Gateway error. This timeout value can be configured in the API Gateway settings. If the Lambda function takes too long to execute or is unable to return a response within the timeout period, the API Gateway will return a 502 error.
Option (A) is incorrect because there is no indication that the output returned from the Lambda proxy integration backend is incompatible. Option (C) is also unlikely as there is no mention of occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads. Finally, option (D) is incorrect because the API name being invalid would not result in a 502 Bad Gateway error specifically for this issue.
