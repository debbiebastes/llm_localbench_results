A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B) The endpoint request timed-out.

When a Lambda function is invoked through an API Gateway proxy integration, the function may time out if it takes too long to execute. This can cause a 502 Bad Gateway error to be returned to the client. In this case, the developer received a 502 error but was able to invoke the underlying Lambda function successfully, which suggests that the issue is likely related to the API Gateway proxy integration rather than the Lambda function itself.
Option (B) The endpoint request timed-out is therefore the most likely root cause of this issue.
