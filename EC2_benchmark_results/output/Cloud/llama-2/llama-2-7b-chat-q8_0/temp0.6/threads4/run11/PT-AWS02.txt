The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
In this scenario, the IT Security team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk by deploying the necessary patches to the outdated EC2 instances. AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager provides a simple and efficient way to automate the patch deployment process across multiple EC2 instances. By integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, the IT Security team can easily record and track any configuration changes made during the patching process.
Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems, but it does not provide a way to integrate with other AWS services for compliance tracking. Option (C) uses AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances, but it does not provide a way to record and track any configuration changes. Option (D) configures the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis, which may not be sufficient to address the immediate security risk.
Therefore, option (A) is the most suitable solution in this scenario.
