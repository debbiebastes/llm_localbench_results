A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day is the MOST operationally efficient solution.

Explanation:

The issue at hand is that the application is slow during the start of the day, which indicates that there might be a shortage of instances or high CPU/Memory utilization. By configuring a Scheduled scaling policy, you can launch new instances before the start of the day, ensuring that there are enough instances available to handle the increased workload at the beginning of the day. This will help in reducing the performance issues during the start of the day.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy is not the best solution as it relies on historical data to predict future usage, which might not accurately represent the current workload. Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on Memory utilization might lead to additional instances being launched when they are not required, leading to wasted resources. Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on CPU utilization is also not the best solution as it might lead to instances being launched with high CPU utilization, which could result in poor performance.
Therefore, configuring a Scheduled scaling policy to launch new instances before the start of the day is the most operationally efficient solution to ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day.
