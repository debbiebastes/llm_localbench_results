A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
This approach uses AWS Config to detect the security groups that allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which is a common source of security risks. By using Systems Manager Automation, you can automate the remediation process by updating the security group rules to only allow traffic from the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is efficient because it relies on AWS Config to detect and update the security groups, rather than manually reviewing and updating each group.
Options (B) and (C) are not the best solutions for this problem because they do not automatically remediate the security risk. Option (B) requires setting up a Transit VPC, which can be complex and time-consuming. Option (C) blocks traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACLs, but it does not update the security group rules to only allow traffic from the corporate firewall IP address.
Option (D) is not a viable solution because AWS Shield is primarily designed for DDoS protection and does not provide the functionality to automatically detect and remediate security risks in security groups.
