An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (A): Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
For mission-critical workloads, it's important to have a persistent block storage volume that is durable and reliable. Instance store volumes are attached directly to the instance and provide fast storage access, making them suitable for mission-critical applications.
Amazon S3 provides a highly scalable and durable storage service that can be used for storing backup data. You can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which provides a low-cost archival storage solution.
Option (B) is incorrect because EBS volumes are block-level storage volumes that are attached to an instance and provide persistent storage. While they are durable and reliable, they may not be the best choice for mission-critical workloads due to their slower access times compared to instance store volumes.
Option (C) is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a single availability zone storage service that provides high availability and low latency for applications that require fast access to data in a single Availability Zone. While it may provide some benefits for certain use cases, it's not the best choice for archiving backup data after 30 days.
Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are attached directly to the instance and do not provide the same level of scalability or durability as Amazon S3.
