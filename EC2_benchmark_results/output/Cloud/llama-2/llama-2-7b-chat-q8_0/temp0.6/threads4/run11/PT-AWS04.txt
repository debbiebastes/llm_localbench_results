Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The answer is (D) 6.

Explanation:
When resharding a Kinesis data stream, you should launch the same number of EC2 instances as the original number of open shards to avoid performance degradation. In this case, since the original stream had four open shards and you increased it to six, you should launch six EC2 instances to achieve optimum performance.
Launching more than six instances would not provide any performance improvement, while launching fewer instances could result in lower throughput and slower processing times. Therefore, option (D) 6 is the correct answer.
