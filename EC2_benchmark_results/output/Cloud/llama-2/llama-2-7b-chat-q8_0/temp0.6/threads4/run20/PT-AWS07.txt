A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The answer is (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation:
The application is slow at the beginning of the day due to insufficient instance capacity. A scheduled scaling policy can be configured to launch new instances before office hours, which will ensure that there are enough instances available for users when they arrive. This will help to improve the performance of the application during the start of the day.
Option (C) provides a more operationally efficient solution than the other options because it allows for automatic scaling based on a schedule, rather than relying on manual intervention or monitoring of resource utilization. By launching new instances before office hours, the application will have sufficient capacity to handle the increased traffic during the start of the day.
Option (A) does not address the issue of insufficient instance capacity at the beginning of the day. Predictive scaling policies can be useful for adjusting instance capacity based on historical usage patterns, but they are not suitable for addressing sudden spikes in demand.
Option (B) is also not the best solution because it relies on monitoring memory utilization, which may not accurately reflect the actual workload of the application. Launching instances based solely on memory utilization can lead to overprovisioning of capacity, resulting in unnecessary costs.
Option (D) does not take into account the specific needs of the application and may result in overprovisioning of capacity during non-peak hours.
