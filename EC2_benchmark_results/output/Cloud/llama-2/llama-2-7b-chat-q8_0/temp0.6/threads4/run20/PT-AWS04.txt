Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation: When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards is increased. In this case, you have six open shards after resharding, which means that each instance can handle two shards each. To achieve optimum performance, you should launch a maximum of six EC2 instances to process the stream, as each instance will be handling two shards. Therefore, option (D) 6 is the correct answer.
