A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
AWS Config provides a way to automate configuration management of your AWS resources, including security groups. By using AWS Config, you can create rules that monitor for specific configurations and automatically update them when they are detected. In this case, you can use AWS Config to detect if any security groups allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and then update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address using an associated Systems Manager Automation document and Lambda function.
The other options are not as efficient or effective:
(B) Setting up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances is not necessary for this scenario, as the traffic can be monitored and controlled through the use of security groups.
(C) Blocking the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACLs is not a scalable or efficient solution, as it would require manual updates every time a new developer adds a rule to a security group.
(D) Using AWS Shield to monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is not specific enough for this scenario, as it would also detect other types of traffic that may be allowed through the security groups.
