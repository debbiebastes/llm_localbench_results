A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B) The endpoint request timed-out.
When a Lambda function is invoked through an AWS API Gateway proxy integration, the integration will wait for the function to complete before returning a response to the client. If the Lambda function takes longer than 30 seconds to execute, the API Gateway will return a 502 Bad Gateway error.
In this case, it's possible that the Lambda function is taking longer than expected to execute, causing the API Gateway to timeout and return the 502 error. To troubleshoot this issue, you can check the Lambda function logs to see if there are any errors or slowdowns occurring during execution.
