The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The most suitable solution in this scenario is (B): Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides a centralized management platform for deploying patches and security updates across multiple instances, including EC2 instances, within an AWS account. It automates the patch management process, ensuring that all instances are up-to-date with the latest security patches. By using Patch Manager, the IT Security team can easily manage and track patch deployments to multiple instances, reducing the risk of security breaches.
In addition, Amazon ES (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) is a fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale Elasticsearch clusters in the cloud. It provides search and analytics capabilities for logging and monitoring data, which can be used to track and record any configuration changes made to patched instances.
Option (A) does not provide a centralized management platform for patch deployment, and Option (C) requires additional setup of AWS Config, which may not be the most efficient solution in this scenario. Option (D) involves manual configuration of weekly patch installations, which may lead to delays in deploying critical security patches.
