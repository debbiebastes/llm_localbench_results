A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The most likely root cause of this issue is (B) The endpoint request timed-out.
When a Lambda function is invoked through an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration, the request might time out if it takes longer than the configured timeout value to complete. This can cause a 502 Bad Gateway error to be returned to the client. In this case, the developer receives the error message even though the underlying Lambda function properly returned the result in XML format.
Option (A) is incorrect because there is no indication that the output returned from the Lambda function is incompatible with the API Gateway proxy integration.
Option (C) is also incorrect because there is no evidence of occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
Option (D) is not related to the issue described in the question.
