A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements is option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

Option (C) provides a scalable, automated, and reliable way to track and record changes made to DynamoDB tables in one region and synchronize them with another region. By using Amazon EventBridge, you can set up a rule that listens to events emitted by DynamoDB table-level operations, such as PutItem or UpdateItem, in the source region. When these events occur, the rule will trigger a Lambda function as a target, which can then process and save the new changes to the other DynamoDB table in the target region.
Option (A) DynamoDB Accelerator is not relevant to this scenario, as it is designed to accelerate read-heavy workloads on a specific DynamoDB table, rather than replicate data between tables.
Option (B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery is not ideal for this use case, as it only provides backup and restore capabilities for entire tables, rather than individual item-level changes. Additionally, it may not be feasible to enable PITR on a large number of tables.
Option (D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table is similar to option (C), but it requires additional configuration and maintenance to set up the stream and handle the incoming events. Additionally, this approach may not provide real-time synchronization between regions.
In summary, using Amazon EventBridge and a Lambda function as a rule target is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements of recording and storing new changes made to DynamoDB items in another region.
