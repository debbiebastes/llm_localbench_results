A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (C): Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
Explanation:
During peak hours, the application experiences increased traffic and demand, causing slow performance due to insufficient instance capacity. To address this issue, implementing a scheduled scaling policy will allow you to launch additional instances before the start of the day, ensuring that there is adequate capacity to handle the expected traffic during office hours.
Option (A) Predictive scaling is not the most operationally efficient solution as it relies on predicting future usage patterns, which can be challenging to accurately forecast. Option (B) Dynamic scaling based on memory utilization may not be effective in addressing the issue as memory utilization may not necessarily indicate slow performance during peak hours. Option (D) Dynamic scaling based on CPU utilization is also not the most operationally efficient solution as it may launch instances that are not fully utilized, resulting in unnecessary costs.
