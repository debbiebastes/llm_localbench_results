Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) 12.

Explanation: When resharding a stream, the number of open shards is increased, which means that more instances are needed to process the data. To achieve optimum performance, you should launch as many EC2 instances as the number of open shards. In this case, since the number of open shards has been increased from 4 to 6, you will need 6 EC2 instances to process the data. Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch is 12 (6 open shards x 2 instances per shard).
Option (A) is incorrect because 5 instances are not enough to process the increased volume of data after resharding. Option (C) is also incorrect because 3 instances are not enough to handle the increased load after resharding. Option (D) is incorrect because 6 instances are already the maximum number needed to achieve optimum performance, and launching more than that will not provide any further performance improvement.
