An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.
Explanation:
A persistent block storage volume, such as an EBS volume, is required for mission-critical workloads. An EBS volume provides a reliable and durable storage solution that can be used to store data that needs to be persisted over time.
Storing the backup data in Amazon S3 is also a good choice because it provides a scalable, durable, and secure storage solution for unstructured data. By using an EBS volume and storing the backup data in Amazon S3, you can ensure that your mission-critical workloads have access to persistent storage while also benefiting from the scalability and security of Amazon S3.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are ephemeral, meaning they are only available while the instance is running. This makes them unsuitable for storing mission-critical data that needs to be persisted over time.
Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a storage service designed for cold data storage, which means it is optimized for infrequently accessed data. While it may be suitable for some use cases, it is not the best choice for storing mission-critical workloads that require persistent access to their data.
Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not available in all AWS regions. If you need to store data across multiple regions, an EBS volume is a better choice because it can be attached to instances in any AWS region where EBS volumes are supported.
