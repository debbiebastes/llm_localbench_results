A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
AWS Config provides a powerful mechanism for monitoring and configuring resources across AWS accounts, regions, and environments. With AWS Config, you can monitor and manage your AWS resources, including security groups, using predefined configurations or custom templates. By using AWS Config to detect unauthorized traffic rules in security groups, you can automatically update the security groups with the corporate firewall IP address without manually searching for and updating each individual security group.
Option (A) is the most efficient because it leverages AWS Config's automated monitoring and remediation capabilities to quickly identify and resolve the security risk. By integrating AWS Config with Systems Manager Automation, you can automate the remediation process without requiring additional manual intervention or resources.
