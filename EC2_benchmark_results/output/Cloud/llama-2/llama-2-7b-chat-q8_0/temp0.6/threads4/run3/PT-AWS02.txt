The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (B): Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
In this scenario, the IT Security team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk by patching the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager can be used to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. This solution provides a centralized and automated way to manage patches across multiple instances, reducing the risk of manual errors or oversights.
Additionally, Amazon ES (Elasticsearch Service) can be used to record and track any configuration changes made during the patching process. This ensures that audit trails are maintained for compliance purposes and helps identify any potential issues or conflicts that may arise during the patching process.
Option (A) is not the most suitable solution because it involves using Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, which may not be necessary in this scenario. Option (C) also does not provide a centralized and automated way to manage patches, which could lead to errors or oversights. Option (D) does not address the immediate need to mitigate the security risk and may not be feasible for large-scale deployments.
