An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (C): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.

Explanation:
An EBS volume provides persistent block storage that can be used for mission-critical workloads. By attaching an EBS volume in the EC2 instance, you can ensure that the data is persisted even if the instance terminates or fails. Amazon S3 provides a scalable and durable object store that can store backup data. You can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA after 30 days. This will provide a cost-effective archiving solution for your backup data.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are ephemeral and do not provide persistent storage. Option (B) is also incorrect because EBS volumes provide better performance and durability than S3 for mission-critical workloads. Option (D) is incorrect because One Zone-IA is a storage class that provides lower latency and higher throughput, but it does not provide the necessary archiving functionality.
