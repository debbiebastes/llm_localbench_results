A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.
Explanation:
The hospital's web application must comply with strict compliance and regulatory requirements by never sending the master keys or unencrypted data to AWS. Client-side encryption is recommended because it encrypts data before it leaves the client, ensuring that even if the data is intercepted during transmission, it remains encrypted.
Using a KMS-managed customer master key provides additional security features, such as key rotation and access controls, to ensure that sensitive patient data is protected from unauthorized access. The Security Engineer can manage the encryption keys securely using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) without storing them in an unsecured location.
Option (A), client-side master key, may not meet compliance requirements because it requires the web application to handle and manage the encryption keys, which could lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled correctly. Option (C), server-side encryption with a customer provided key, is not recommended because it requires the hospital's web application to send the unencrypted data to AWS for encryption, violating compliance requirements. Option (D) is incorrect because KMS does not provide a managed master key for client-side encryption.
