A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
Explanation:
The issue at hand is that the application is slow during the start of the day, which indicates that there are not enough instances available to handle the increased load. A scheduled scaling policy can be configured to automatically launch new instances before the start of the day, ensuring that there are sufficient instances available to handle the expected load.
Option (A) Predictive scaling is not the best solution in this case as it relies on historical data to predict future usage and may not take into account any unexpected changes in load. Option (B) Dynamic scaling based on memory utilization may also not be effective as the increase in memory utilization may not necessarily indicate an increase in load, and may instead be due to other factors such as caching or warming up of instances. Option (D) Dynamic scaling based on CPU utilization is also not the best solution as it may lead to overprovisioning of instances during off-peak hours.
Therefore, configuring a scheduled scaling policy to launch new instances before the start of the day is the most operationally efficient solution to ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day.
