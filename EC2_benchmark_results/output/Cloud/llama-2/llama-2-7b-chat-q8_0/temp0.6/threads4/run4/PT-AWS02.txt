The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (C): Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
Option (C) provides a comprehensive solution that addresses both the immediate security risk and audit requirements. Here's why:
1. Patch Management: AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager is designed specifically for managing patches across multiple instances. It simplifies the process of deploying patches to EC2 instances, including those with old operating systems. By using Patch Manager, the team can quickly identify and apply necessary patches to mitigate the security risk.
1. Compliance Tracking: AWS Config is a service that enables organizations to track changes to their infrastructure and applications across multiple services, including EC2. By setting up AWS Config, the team can easily record and track any configuration changes related to the patch management process, ensuring compliance with auditing requirements.
In contrast, options (A) and (B) have limitations:
Option (A) requires integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, which may add complexity to the solution. Additionally, relying solely on QuickSight for compliance tracking might not provide sufficient visibility into configuration changes.
Option (B) involves using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, but it does not provide a comprehensive solution for tracking configuration changes. While ES can track some configuration changes, it may not capture all relevant data required for auditing purposes.
Therefore, the most suitable solution is to use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager in conjunction with AWS Config to easily deploy patches and record compliance-related changes.
