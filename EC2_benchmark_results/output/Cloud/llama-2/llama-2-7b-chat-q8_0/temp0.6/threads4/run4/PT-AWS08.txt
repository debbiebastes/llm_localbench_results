An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.
Explanation:

To meet the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, you should use an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume in your Amazon EC2 instance. EBS volumes are designed to provide high-performance, durable storage for EC2 instances and offer several advantages over instance store volumes, including:
* Persistent storage: EBS volumes are persistent, meaning that they will be preserved even if the underlying EC2 instance is terminated or deleted.
* Durability: EBS volumes are durable, meaning that data will not be lost due to hardware failures or other unforeseen events.
* Scalability: EBS volumes can be easily scaled up or down as needed, making it easy to accommodate changes in workload requirements.

To store your backup data, you should use Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). S3 provides a highly durable and scalable storage solution that is ideal for storing large amounts of data, including backups. You can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which will provide long-term archiving and preservation of your backup data.
In summary, the correct answer is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance, and use Amazon S3 to store your backup data, with a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days.
