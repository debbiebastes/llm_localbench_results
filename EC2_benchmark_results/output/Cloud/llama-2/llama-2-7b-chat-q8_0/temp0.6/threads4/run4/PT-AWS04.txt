Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The correct answer is (D) 6.

Explanation: When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards is increased, which means that more instances can process the data simultaneously. In this case, you have six open shards after resharding, and each instance has one KCL worker. Therefore, to achieve optimum performance, you should launch at most six EC2 instances to process the data. Launching more than six instances would not improve performance significantly, as the additional instances would not be able to utilize the available resources efficiently due to the limited number of open shards.
