A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is:

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:
This option is the most efficient because it leverages AWS Config, which is a service that allows you to manage and monitor your AWS resources, including security groups, using tags and configurations. By setting up an AWS Config rule, you can automatically detect if there are any security groups that allow inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and then remediate those security groups by updating them with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach eliminates the need for manual intervention and reduces the risk of human error.
Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances, which may be overkill for this scenario. Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, but it doesn't remediate the security groups. Option (D) uses AWS Shield to monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but it doesn't provide automatic remediation.
