A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

The correct answer is (B): "Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key."

Explanation: 

To ensure that the sensitive PII of patients is not accessible to AWS, the Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption using a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach ensures that the master key for encrypting and decrypting data remains in the customer's control, rather than being stored or managed by AWS.
Option (A) is incorrect because it involves storing the master key on the client side, which goes against the company's security policy and regulatory requirements. Option (C) is also incorrect since server-side encryption would require the master key to be managed by AWS, which is not allowed. Finally, option (D) is not a valid choice as it involves using a customer-provided key, which could lead to compliance issues.
