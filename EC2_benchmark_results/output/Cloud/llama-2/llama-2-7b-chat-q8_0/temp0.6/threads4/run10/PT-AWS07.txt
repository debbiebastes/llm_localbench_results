A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (A): Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances.
Explanation:
As the users are complaining about slow performance during the start of the day, it indicates that the application requires more instances at the beginning of the day to handle the increased traffic. Predictive scaling can help in this scenario by automatically adding or removing instances based on historical data and forecasted usage. This way, the system can scale up beforehand to handle the expected traffic during the peak hours.
Configuring a Dynamic scaling policy (option B) will not be operationally efficient in this case as it will launch new instances based on the Memory utilization, which may not necessarily correlate with the increased traffic during the start of the day. Similarly, configuring a Scheduled scaling policy (option C) will not automatically adjust the number of instances beforehand to handle the expected traffic at the beginning of the day. Option D is incorrect as CPU utilization alone may not accurately predict the traffic and performance requirements of the application.
