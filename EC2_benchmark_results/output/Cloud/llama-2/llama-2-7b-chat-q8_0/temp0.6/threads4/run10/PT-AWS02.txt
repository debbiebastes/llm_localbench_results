The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is:

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the IT Security team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk by deploying patches to the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager is the most suitable solution for this task as it allows for the efficient and secure deployment of OS patches to multiple EC2 instances at once.
Additionally, integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana provides a centralized platform for tracking and recording any configuration changes made to the patched EC2 instances. This helps ensure compliance and auditability of the patching process.
Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy patches, but does not provide integration with a centralized platform for tracking configuration changes. Option (C) uses AWS Config to record and track configuration changes, but does not provide a direct solution for deploying OS patches. Option (D) configures the EC2 instances to automatically install patches on a weekly basis, but does not address the immediate need to mitigate the security risk.
