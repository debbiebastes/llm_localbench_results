An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.
Explanation:
You need a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, so an EBS volume is the best choice. EBS volumes are designed for storing data that requires high availability and durability, making them ideal for mission-critical applications.
Storing your backup data in Amazon S3 is also the right choice because it provides a scalable and durable storage solution with features such as object versioning, cross-region replication, and encryption. However, you may not need to use Amazon S3 Glacier or Amazon S3 One Zone-IA for this use case since they are designed for long-term archival storage and cold data storage, respectively.
Therefore, option (B) is the best answer because it meets the requirement of using an EBS volume in your EC2 instance to store your backup data in Amazon S3.
