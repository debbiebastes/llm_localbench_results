Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation: When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the maximum number of open shards is a critical factor in determining the performance of your application. In this case, since you already have four shards with one KCL worker each, doubling the number of shards to six will provide optimum performance.
Option (D) 6 is the correct answer because it matches the number of open shards that will be available after resharding the stream. Launching more than six EC2 instances will not provide any additional performance benefits and may actually lead to increased costs and complexity.
