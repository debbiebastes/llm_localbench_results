A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements in this scenario is (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Here's why:

* Option (A), DynamoDB Accelerator, is not relevant to this scenario as it is intended for improving read performance only.
* Option (B), DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery, can be used to recover data from a point in time, but it does not provide the necessary auditing features to record changes made to items in DynamoDB.
* Option (D), DynamoDB Streams, is also not relevant as it is intended for real-time processing of stream data, and the requirements specify that changes must be recorded in another table in another region.
By using Amazon EventBridge and a Lambda function as a rule target, you can easily track and record changes made to items in DynamoDB in near real-time. This approach provides an auditable history of all changes made to the items in DynamoDB, which meets the requirements specified in the scenario.
