Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).

Event-driven applications are applications that react to occurrences or events in the system. AWS provides a number of services that enable you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture, including Amazon EventBridge, Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS), Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), and Amazon Kinesis.
Amazon EventBridge is an event bus service that enables you to decouple the components of your application architecture by allowing them to communicate with each other through events. It allows you to subscribe to events generated by AWS services or custom applications, and then react to those events by triggering other AWS services or custom applications.
Amazon SQS is a message queuing service that enables you to decouple the components of your application architecture by allowing them to communicate with each other through messages. It allows you to send messages from one component of your application to another, and then react to those messages by triggering other AWS services or custom applications.
Amazon SNS is a messaging service that enables you to decouple the components of your application architecture by allowing them to communicate with each other through messages. It allows you to send messages from one component of your application to another, and then react to those messages by triggering other AWS services or custom applications.
Amazon Kinesis is a streaming service that enables you to decouple the components of your application architecture by allowing them to communicate with each other through real-time data streams. It allows you to collect and process real-time data from multiple sources, and then react to that data by triggering other AWS services or custom applications.
In summary, Amazon EventBridge is the service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture in AWS.
