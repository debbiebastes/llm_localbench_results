A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The most likely root cause of this issue is (A): There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

When a Lambda function is invoked via an API Gateway proxy integration, it returns a response to the client. If the response is not in the expected format, such as XML, the API Gateway may return a 502 Bad Gateway error to the client. In this case, the developer received an XML response from the underlying Lambda function, indicating that there was an incompatible output returned from the Lambda proxy integration backend.
Option (B) is incorrect because the endpoint request did not time out. Option (C) is unlikely because there is no mention of heavy loads causing occasional out-of-order invocations. Option (D) is also incorrect because the API name is not invalid in this case.
