A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The most cost-effective option would be (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This is because the application will be used for more than 3 years, so using a Reserved Instance with an upfront payment will provide the greatest cost savings over the long term.
The other options are not as cost-effective:
(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term provides only temporary cost savings, and may not be the most cost-effective option if the application is used for more than 1 year.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term does not provide any upfront payment discounts and would result in higher costs over the long term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year provides temporary cost savings, but may not be the most cost-effective option if the application is used for more than 1 year.
