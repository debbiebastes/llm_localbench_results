Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The maximum number of EC2 instances needed for optimum performance in this scenario would be (D) 6.
As you resharded the Kinesis data stream from four shards to six shards, it means that each instance will have two additional shards to process. Therefore, to achieve optimum performance, you should launch a maximum of six EC2 instances, one for each shard, so that each instance can handle the load efficiently.
Option (A) 5 is incorrect because five EC2 instances would not be enough to handle the increased workload caused by resharding the stream. Similarly, option (B) 12 is also incorrect because six instances are needed to handle the extra shards, and launching more than that may result in overprovisioning and increased costs. Option (C) 3 is incorrect because three instances would not be enough to handle the load efficiently, especially when resharding the stream.
