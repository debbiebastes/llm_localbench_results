A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

The best answer is (B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

API Gateway has built-in capabilities for handling traffic spikes, such as enabling throttling limits to control the number of requests that can be processed within a given time period. By setting up throttling limits, you can prevent the backend system from being overwhelmed by an unexpected surge in traffic.
Result caching is another feature of API Gateway that can help handle traffic spikes by storing frequently accessed data in a cache and retrieving it instead of making repeated requests to the backend system. This can significantly reduce the load on the backend system during periods of high traffic.
While options (A) and (C) may provide more scalability and availability, they are not directly related to handling traffic spikes and may require additional setup and configuration. Option (D) is not a feasible solution as it would require relocating the Lambda function to a VPC, which is not necessary in this scenario.
