A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements is (C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
Here's why:
EventBridge is a serverless event bus that allows you to connect different services, such as DynamoDB, Lambda, and S3, and trigger Lambda functions based on specific events. In this scenario, you can create an EventBridge rule that listens for table-level events in DynamoDB (e.g., new items added, items updated, items deleted) and triggers a Lambda function to process and save the changes to the other DynamoDB table in another region.
Using EventBridge has several advantages over the other options:
* It does not require any additional infrastructure or services (such as DynamoDB Accelerator or Point-in-Time Recovery).
* It is a serverless service, so you don't have to worry about provisioning or scaling resources.
* It provides a flexible and customizable way to handle events, allowing you to choose which events to listen for and how to process them.
* It integrates well with other AWS services, such as Lambda and DynamoDB, making it easy to set up and manage your serverless application.
In summary, using EventBridge is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements because it is a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective solution that integrates well with other AWS services.
