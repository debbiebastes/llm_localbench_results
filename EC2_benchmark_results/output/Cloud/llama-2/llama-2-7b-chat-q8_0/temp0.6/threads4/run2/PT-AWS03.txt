A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Using AWS Config rules, you can set up a rule that monitors for security groups allowing traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. If such a security group is found, the rule will automatically update the security group to allow traffic only from the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is efficient because it automates the remediation process without requiring manual intervention or additional monitoring.
Option (B) setting up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances is not the most efficient way to remediate this risk, as it requires additional infrastructure deployment and configuration.
Option (C) blocking the source IP addresses coming from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL is not a scalable solution for remediation, as it will block all traffic from that range, including legitimate traffic to other services.
Option (D) using AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is not a practical solution for remediation, as it requires additional setup and configuration of AWS Shield, which may not be feasible or necessary in this case.
