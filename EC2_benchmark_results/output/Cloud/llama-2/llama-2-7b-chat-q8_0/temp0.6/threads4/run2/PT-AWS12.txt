A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
Explanation:
Reserved Instances provide a discount on the On-Demand instance prices in exchange for a commitment to use the instance for a specified period of time. The cost-effectiveness of using Reserved Instances depends on how long you plan to use the instance and what type of Reserved Instance pricing is available.
For applications that will be used for more than 3 years, the most cost-effective option is to choose a No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option provides the largest discount compared to other Reserved Instance pricing options.
All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing and All Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing, as options (A) and (C), provide smaller discounts compared to No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. Additionally, these options require an upfront payment that may not be feasible for some companies.
Therefore, option (B) is the most cost-effective choice for a company planning to use their application for more than 3 years.
