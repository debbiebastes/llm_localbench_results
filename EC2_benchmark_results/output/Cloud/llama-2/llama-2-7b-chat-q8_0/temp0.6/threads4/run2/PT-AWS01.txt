A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
Explanation:
The Security Engineer should implement Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key to meet the compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. This approach ensures that sensitive data is encrypted on the client side before it reaches AWS, preventing unauthorized access even if the data is stored in an unencrypted state in S3.
Option (A) is incorrect because client-side encryption with a client-side master key does not provide sufficient security for sensitive PII data. A client-side master key could be compromised, leading to unauthorized access to encrypted data.
Option (C) is also incorrect because server-side encryption with a KMS-managed key does not provide adequate control over the encryption process. The company needs to manage its own encryption keys for compliance and regulatory reasons.
Option (D) is not a valid choice because customer-provided keys are not supported by AWS S3.
