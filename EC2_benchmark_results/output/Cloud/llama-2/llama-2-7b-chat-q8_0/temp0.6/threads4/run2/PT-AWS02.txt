The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is option (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Reasoning:
This option provides a comprehensive approach to addressing the security vulnerability in the old operating systems of the EC2 instances, while also meeting audit requirements for recording changes and maintaining compliance statuses. By using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, the IT Security team can easily deploy the patches across all affected instances, ensuring that they are updated and secure. Additionally, integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana allows for real-time monitoring and tracking of configuration changes, providing a centralized view of the system's compliance status.
In contrast, options (B) and (C) do not provide the same level of automation and integration as option (A). Option (B) requires manual configuration of AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, which may lead to delays in deploying patches and increased risk of human error. Option (C) relies on AWS Config for tracking changes, but this may not provide real-time monitoring or integrated reporting with Kibana.
Option (D) is not a feasible solution as it does not address the immediate need to mitigate the security vulnerability in the outdated operating systems of the EC2 instances.
