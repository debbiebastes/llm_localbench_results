An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
To meet the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, option (A) is the best choice. Attaching an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance provides a persistent block storage volume that will be available as long as the instance is running. This is suitable for storing data that needs to be persisted across instance restarts or reboots.
Option (B) is not the best choice because it involves attaching an EBS volume, which is not a persistent storage option and will be deleted when the instance is terminated. Option (C) is also not the best choice because it involves storing data in Amazon S3 One Zone-IA, which is a regional storage service that may not provide the necessary performance or availability for mission-critical workloads.
Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for storing backup data, as they are designed to be ephemeral and will be deleted when the instance is terminated.
