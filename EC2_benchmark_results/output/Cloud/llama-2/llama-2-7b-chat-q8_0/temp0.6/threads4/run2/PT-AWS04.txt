Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation: When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards is increased to allow for more instances to process the data. Since you have six open shards after resharding, you can launch up to six EC2 instances to achieve optimum performance. Launching more than six instances will not result in improved performance, and could lead to unnecessary costs.
