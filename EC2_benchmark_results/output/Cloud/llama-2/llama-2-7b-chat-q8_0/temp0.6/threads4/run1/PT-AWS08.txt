An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
An EBS volume provides persistent block storage that can be attached to an EC2 instance, offering high throughput and low latency for mission-critical workloads. By attaching an EBS volume in the EC2 instance, you will have a dedicated storage volume for your organization's data.
Amazon S3 is a scalable and durable object storage service that can store large amounts of data, including backup data. You can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects from Amazon S3 to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which will provide long-term archiving capabilities at lower costs.
Amazon S3 Glacier is a cold storage archive that provides a very low cost storage option for infrequently accessed data. By storing the backup data in Amazon S3 and transitioning it to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, you will have a cost-effective solution for long-term archiving of mission-critical workloads.
In summary, attaching an EBS volume in your EC2 instance and using Amazon S3 to store the backup data with a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier meets the requirement of providing a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads while also meeting the cost and scalability requirements.
