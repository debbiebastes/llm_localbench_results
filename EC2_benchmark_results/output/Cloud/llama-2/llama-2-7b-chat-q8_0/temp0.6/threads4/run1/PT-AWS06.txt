A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B): The endpoint request timed-out. When a Lambda function is invoked through an API Gateway proxy integration, the invocation can time out if the function takes too long to execute or if there are issues with the network connection. This can result in a 502 Bad Gateway error being returned to the client.
Option (B) is the best answer because it is the most likely cause of this issue based on the information provided. Options (A), (C), and (D) do not match the symptoms described in the question.
