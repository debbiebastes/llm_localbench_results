A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.
Explanation:
The hospital's application should not store or transmit sensitive PII data in plaintext, even within the AWS infrastructure. Therefore, server-side encryption options like (D) are not feasible.
Client-side encryption with an unmanaged customer master key (Option A) is also not recommended because it does not provide adequate security and compliance benefits. The hospital needs to manage its own encryption keys securely, which is the responsibility of the Security Engineer.
Using a KMS-managed customer master key (Option B) provides an ideal solution for this use case. With this approach, Amazon S3 uses a KMS-managed key to encrypt data stored in the bucket, and the hospital's application can only decrypt the data using its own client-side encryption with the corresponding KMS-managed customer master key. This ensures that sensitive PII data remains encrypted and protected throughout its lifecycle, even within AWS infrastructure.
