A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution to implement is (C): Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day. This will ensure that the application has enough instances available during the peak hours, and can handle the increased load without any performance issues.

Explanation:

Option (A) Predictive scaling is useful when you want to predict future usage patterns based on historical data, but it may not be effective in this scenario as the slow start of the day is a known issue that occurs every day.
Option (B) Dynamic scaling is useful when you want to adjust the number of instances based on real-time metrics like CPU or Memory utilization, but it may not be effective in this scenario as the issue is with the startup time and not with the average usage patterns during office hours.
Option (D) Dynamic scaling based on CPU utilization may also not be effective here as the issue is related to the startup time and not with the CPU usage during peak hours.

Therefore, the best option to address this issue is to configure a Scheduled scaling policy that launches new instances before the start of the day, ensuring that there are enough instances available when the users start using the application. This will help mitigate any performance issues during the startup time and ensure a smooth user experience.
