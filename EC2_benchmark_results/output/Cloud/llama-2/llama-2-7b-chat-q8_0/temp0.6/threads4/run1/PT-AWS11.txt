Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events). EventBridge is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a centralized platform for collecting, processing, and routing events from various sources, such as AWS services, on-premises applications, and custom applications.
Option (A) Amazon SQS is a message queuing service that can be used to decouple components of an application architecture, but it does not provide the same level of event-driven functionality as EventBridge. Option (C) Amazon SNS is a messaging service that can be used to decouple components of an application architecture through the use of publish-subscribe topics, but it is primarily designed for pushing messages from one component of an application to another rather than collecting and processing events. Option (D) Amazon Kinesis is a stream processing service that can be used to handle large amounts of real-time, distributed data, but it does not provide the same level of event-driven functionality as EventBridge.
