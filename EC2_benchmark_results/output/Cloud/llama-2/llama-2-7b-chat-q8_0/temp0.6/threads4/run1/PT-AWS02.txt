The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is option (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
In this scenario, the IT Security team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk by deploying the OS patches for the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager provides a fast and secure way to deploy patches across multiple instances at once. By integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, the team can record and track any configuration changes made during the patching process.
Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. While this option may work, it is not the most suitable solution as it does not provide real-time monitoring and tracking of the patch deployment process.
Option (C) uses AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. However, this option does not provide real-time monitoring and tracking of the patch deployment process.
Option (D) configures the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis. While this may be a suitable solution in some cases, it is not the most suitable solution in this scenario as it does not address the immediate security risk.
