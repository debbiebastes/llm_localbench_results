A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements would be (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
Explanation:
EventBridge is a fully managed service that makes it easy to detect changes in time-series data stored in Amazon CloudWatch, like DynamoDB. By creating an EventBridge rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, you can automatically capture new changes made to the items in the original DynamoDB table and save them to a new DynamoDB table in another region.
Option (A) DynamoDB Accelerator is not relevant to this scenario as it is designed to accelerate queries on a single DynamoDB table, not to track changes across multiple tables.
Option (B) Enabling Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) would not automatically sync the two tables. While PITR can be used to recover data from a point in time, it does not provide real-time tracking of changes made to DynamoDB tables.
Option (D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table is similar to option (C), but it requires more configuration and setup. While it can be used to track changes in DynamoDB, it may not be as straightforward or efficient as using EventBridge.
