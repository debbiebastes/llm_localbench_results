A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 

The MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements is option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach provides the following benefits:

1. **Real-time monitoring**: With EventBridge, you can monitor DynamoDB tables for changes in real-time, which is essential for compliance.
2. **Automatic processing**: Once you set up an event rule, EventBridge will automatically process new changes and trigger your Lambda function to save them to the other table. This ensures that no data is lost or overlooked during the sync process.
3. **Cost-effective**: Using EventBridge instead of DynamoDB Accelerator or Point-in-Time Recovery can be more cost-effective, especially if you have a large number of tables to monitor and sync.
4. **Flexibility**: With EventBridge, you can set up multiple rule targets for different processing flows, allowing you to customize your compliance process according to your needs.

In summary, option (C) provides the most ideal solution by enabling real-time monitoring, automating the sync process, and being cost-effective and flexible.
