A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The most likely root cause of this issue is (B) The endpoint request timed-out. When a Lambda function is being called through an API Gateway, the request will be sent to the Lambda function and then returned back to the API Gateway as a response. If the Lambda function takes too long to execute or if there are high loads on the system, it can cause the API Gateway to timeout and return a 502 Bad Gateway error.
Option (A) is incorrect because there is no indication that the output returned from the Lambda function is incompatible with the API Gateway. Option (C) is also unlikely, as there are no signs of an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads. Option (D) does not apply in this scenario since the API name is valid.
