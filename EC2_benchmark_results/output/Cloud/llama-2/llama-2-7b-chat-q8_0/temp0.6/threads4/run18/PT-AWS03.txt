A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
This approach is the most efficient because it uses AWS Config, which provides real-time visibility into configuration changes across your AWS environment. By using AWS Config, you can automatically detect and remediate security risks like this without requiring manual intervention. Additionally, by associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule, you can automate the remediation process, ensuring that the security group is updated with the corporate firewall IP address as soon as possible.

Option (B) setting up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because it would require manual configuration of the Transit VPC and its associated routes, which could take time and effort.

Option (C) blocking the source IP addresses coming from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because it would only block incoming traffic from the specified IP range, but it would not automatically update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Option (D) using AWS Shield to monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because it would only provide real-time monitoring of security groups, but it would not automatically update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
