The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
Option (A) provides a comprehensive solution that addresses both the immediate security risk mitigation and the audit requirements. By deploying the OS patches using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, the IT Security team can quickly and securely apply the patches to all affected EC2 instances. Integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana allows for real-time monitoring of configuration changes, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
Option (B) involves setting up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, which can automatically deploy patches to EC2 instances. However, this approach does not provide the same level of visibility and control as Option (A), as it does not integrate with Amazon QuickSight or Kibana.
Option (C) uses AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy OS patches, but does not provide a centralized solution for recording configuration changes. While AWS Config can record configuration changes, it is not specifically designed for tracking patch management activities.
Option (D) involves configuring EC2 instances to automatically install patches on a weekly basis, which may not be sufficient for addressing immediate security risks. Additionally, this approach does not provide real-time monitoring and reporting capabilities like the other options.
