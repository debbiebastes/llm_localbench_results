An e-commerce company wants to migrate its on-premise infrastructure to Amazon Web Services. However, they are worried about ensuring their migration is secure and efficient.

(A) Security Perspective
(B) Governance Perspective
(C) Operations Perspective
(D) Platform Perspective

Answer: 
(C) Operations Perspective

Explanation:
The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework provides a structured approach to migrating workloads to the AWS cloud. Of the four perspectives offered in the framework, the Operations Perspective is the most essential for a migration project like this company's. This perspective focuses on optimizing the operational efficiency of the migration by identifying and addressing potential issues before they become problems.
Some of the key tasks included in the Operations Perspective are:
1. Assessment: Evaluate the current infrastructure and applications to identify areas that can be optimized or migrated to AWS.
2. Planning: Develop a migration plan that includes timelines, milestones, and resource requirements.
3. Migration: Conduct a phased migration of the on-premises infrastructure to AWS, including data migration, application migration, and network configuration.
4. Validation: Verify that the migrated environment is fully operational and meets business requirements.
By focusing on the Operations Perspective, the company can ensure their migration is secure and efficient by identifying potential issues early on and addressing them before they become major problems.
