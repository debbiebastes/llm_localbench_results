An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.
Here's why:
An EBS volume provides persistent block storage that can be attached to multiple EC2 instances, which makes it a good choice for mission-critical workloads. The backup data can be stored in Amazon S3, which offers durable and scalable object storage. Using an EBS volume ensures that the backup data is persisted even if the instance terminates or is rebooted.
Option (A) attaches an instance store volume, which provides block-level access to the instance's memory but is not persistent by default. This may not be suitable for mission-critical workloads that require persistent storage.
Option (C) attaches an EBS volume in a specific Availability Zone, which may not provide adequate performance or redundancy for certain use cases.
Option (D) attaches an instance store volume in a specific Availability Zone, which may not provide adequate performance or redundancy for certain use cases.
In summary, the best solution is to attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance to provide persistent block storage for mission-critical workloads, and then store the backup data in Amazon S3 using a lifecycle policy to transition the objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days.
