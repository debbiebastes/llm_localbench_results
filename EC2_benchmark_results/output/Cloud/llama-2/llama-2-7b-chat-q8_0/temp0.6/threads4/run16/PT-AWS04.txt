Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

The maximum number of EC2 instances that you can launch to achieve optimum performance is (D) 6.

Explanation:

When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards must be a power of 2. In this case, increasing the number of open shards from 4 to 6 means that each instance will have two additional shards to process, resulting in a total of 6 shards per instance.
Since each instance has one KCL worker, the maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched to achieve optimum performance is 6. Launching more than 6 instances would not provide any additional processing power or scalability benefits, and could result in wasted resources and increased costs.
Therefore, the answer is (D) 6.
