A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements is option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach provides the following benefits:
1. **Event-driven architecture**: By using EventBridge, you can decouple your application's logic from the underlying DynamoDB database, allowing for more flexibility and scalability in your system.
2. **Automated processing**: With a CloudWatch Events rule, you can automate the process of saving new changes to the other table in another region without requiring manual intervention.
3. **Real-time monitoring**: EventBridge provides real-time monitoring of DynamoDB events, enabling you to quickly identify and address any issues that may arise.
4. **Cost-effective**: Using CloudWatch Events is a cost-effective solution as it only charges for the events that are processed, without requiring additional infrastructure or resource allocation.
5. **Flexible implementation**: With EventBridge, you can choose from a variety of Lambda functions or other services to process and save new changes to the other table, providing flexibility in your implementation.
6. **Easy integration with existing infrastructure**: Since EventBridge integrates with AWS services like Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB, you can easily integrate it into your existing serverless architecture without requiring significant changes or additional infrastructure.
