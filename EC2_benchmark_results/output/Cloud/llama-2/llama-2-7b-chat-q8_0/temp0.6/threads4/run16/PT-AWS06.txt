A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The most likely root cause of this issue is (B): The endpoint request timed-out.
When a Lambda function is invoked through an API Gateway proxy integration, the function call may timeout if the underlying function takes too long to execute. This can result in a 502 Bad Gateway error being returned to the client. To troubleshoot this issue, you can check the Lambda function's execution logs to see if it timed out and also ensure that your API Gateway integration is configured to handle timeouts properly.
Option (A) is incorrect because there is no incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend. Option (C) is also incorrect because occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads is not the most likely cause of this issue. Option (D) is incorrect because the API name being invalid is not the root cause of a 502 Bad Gateway error.
