A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk would be option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

By using AWS Config, you can automatically detect changes to security groups that allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range without manual monitoring or approval processes. The AWS Lambda function will then be triggered to update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address, ensuring that all traffic goes through the approved route.

Options (B), (C), and (D) do not provide an efficient solution for automatic remediation of this security risk:

Option (B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances: While this approach can help route traffic through the corporate firewall, it does not automatically update security groups with the correct IP address.

Option (C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL: This approach does not address the issue of allowing traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in security groups and may cause additional complexity and operational overhead.

Option (D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range: While AWS Shield can help monitor for security threats, it does not provide a solution for automatic remediation of security risks in security groups.
