The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.

Reasoning:

AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager provides a secure, reliable, and automated way to deploy patches on EC2 instances. By leveraging Sessions Manager, the IT Security team can easily manage the patch deployment process across multiple instances. Moreover, integrating QuickSight with Kibana enables the team to monitor and track any changes made to the configuration, ensuring compliance and audit readiness.

Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy patches, but it does not provide real-time tracking of configuration changes. Option (C) uses AWS Config to record and track configuration changes, but it requires more manual effort to set up and maintain compared to Sessions Manager. Option (D) is not the most suitable solution as it involves configuring the instances to automatically install patches on a weekly basis, which may not be feasible or efficient in all cases.

Therefore, the best answer is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, and integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
