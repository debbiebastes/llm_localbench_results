A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
To ensure that the sensitive PII of the hospital's patients is stored securely in AWS, the Security Engineer should implement option (B) - "Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key."
Explanation:
By using a KMS-managed customer master key for client-side encryption, the hospital can keep its PII secure even if the S3 bucket is compromised. The master key is managed by AWS Key Management Service (KMS), which provides secure and tamper-proof key management. This ensures that only authorized parties can access the data, as only they will have possession of the encryption keys.
Option (A) - "Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key" is not suitable for storing sensitive PII, as the master key is stored in plaintext on the client's system, which could lead to unauthorized access to the data.
Option (C) - "Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key" is also not recommended, as it may not meet regulatory requirements for compliance and security.
Option (D) - "Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key" is not feasible in this scenario, as the hospital needs to ensure that only authorized parties have access to the encryption keys.
