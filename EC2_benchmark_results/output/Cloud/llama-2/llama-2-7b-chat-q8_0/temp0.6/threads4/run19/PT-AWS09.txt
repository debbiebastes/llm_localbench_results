A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

The best answer is (B): Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
API Gateway provides features such as throttling limits, which can help manage traffic spikes by limiting the number of requests that can be made to the backend APIs within a given time period. This can prevent the backend systems from being overwhelmed and help ensure that they remain available and responsive.
Result caching in API Gateway allows you to cache the results of API calls, so that subsequent requests for the same data do not need to make an additional request to the backend API. This can significantly reduce the load on the backend systems during traffic spikes, as fewer requests need to be made.
Option (B) is the best answer because it provides a scalable and highly available architecture for managing traffic spikes in the backend systems of a cryptocurrency trading platform. By enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway, you can significantly reduce the load on the backend systems during traffic spikes, ensuring that they remain available and responsive even under heavy loads.

Option (A) is not the best answer because while EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling provide a more scalable architecture, they may not be able to handle sudden traffic spikes as effectively as throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway. Additionally, moving to a more complex architecture can be time-consuming and costly, and may not be necessary for managing traffic spikes.
Option (C) is not the best answer because while CloudFront can act as a cache in front of the API Gateway, it does not provide throttling limits or result caching capabilities, which are essential for managing traffic spikes in the backend systems of a cryptocurrency trading platform.
Option (D) is not the best answer because moving the Lambda function to a VPC may not have any significant impact on traffic spikes management, as the VPC does not provide throttling limits or result caching capabilities out of the box.
