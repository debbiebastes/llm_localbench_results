A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 

The best answer is (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

Option (C) provides the most ideal solution for complying with the IT compliance requirements. Here's why:

1. Cost-effective: Using Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as CloudWatch Events) is a cost-effective way to track DynamoDB events and trigger Lambda functions without incurring additional charges for another service like DynamoDB Accelerator or Point-in-Time Recovery.
2. Flexible: Amazon EventBridge provides flexibility in terms of event sources, event filters, and rule targets. You can configure the rule to capture events from specific tables in a particular region and trigger Lambda functions only for those tables.
3. Easy implementation: Creating an EventBridge rule is relatively easy to set up, especially if you're already familiar with AWS services like Lambda and DynamoDB. You don't need to worry about the underlying infrastructure or maintenance tasks associated with other options.
4. Scalability: With EventBridge, you can easily scale your solution as needed by increasing the number of event sources or rule targets without worrying about capacity constraints.
5. Auditing and logging: EventBridge provides detailed logs for all events, which can be useful for auditing purposes. This helps ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and maintains a record of changes made to data in DynamoDB.
6. Real-time processing: You can configure the Lambda function as a rule target to process new changes in real-time, ensuring that the other table remains up-to-date with the latest data.
7. No dependency on other services: Unlike options (A) and (B), you don't need to rely on additional AWS services like DynamoDB Accelerator or Point-in-Time Recovery to achieve compliance. This simplifies the solution architecture and reduces potential dependencies that could impact scalability or availability.

In summary, Option (C) provides a cost-effective, flexible, easy-to-implement, scalable, auditable, and real-time solution for capturing changes made to data in DynamoDB and
