A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is:

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Explanation:
Option (A) is the most efficient way to automate the remediation process because it uses AWS Config rules to detect the security groups that allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and then associates a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function to update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is efficient because it automates the remediation process without requiring manual intervention or additional infrastructure.
Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances, which may not be necessary in this scenario since the company already has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.
Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, but this approach may not be effective in remediating the security risk since it only blocks incoming traffic and does not update the security group to allow traffic from the corporate firewall.
Option (D) uses AWS Shield to monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but this approach may not be effective in remediating the security risk since it only monitors and detects the security groups, but does not update them automatically.
