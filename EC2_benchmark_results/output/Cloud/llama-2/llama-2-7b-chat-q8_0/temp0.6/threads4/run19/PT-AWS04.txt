Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation: When resharding your Kinesis data stream, the maximum number of open shards that can be created is six. This means that you should launch a maximum of six EC2 instances to process the increased number of shards. Launching more than six EC2 instances will not result in better performance and will only increase costs.
