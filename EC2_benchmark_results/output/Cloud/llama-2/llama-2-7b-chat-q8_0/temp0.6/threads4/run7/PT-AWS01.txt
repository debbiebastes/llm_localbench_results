A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
Explanation: 
The Security Engineer should implement Amazon S3 client-side encryption using a KMS-managed customer master key to meet the compliance requirements of storing sensitive PII of patients. Client-side encryption means that the data is encrypted on the client's (in this case, the hospital's) side before it is uploaded to S3, and the encryption keys are managed by the client. This ensures that the master keys and unencrypted data never leave the hospital's premises, complying with the regulatory requirements.
Option A is incorrect because client-side encryption requires a customer-managed master key, which means the security engineer would have to manage the master key themselves, which goes against the regulatory requirement of not sending sensitive information outside of the hospital. 
Option (C) is also incorrect because server-side encryption involves AWS managing the encryption keys, which would result in sending the unencrypted data to AWS, again going against the compliance requirements.
Option D is incorrect because using a customer-provided key would still require the security engineer to manage the master key themselves, which goes against the regulatory requirement of not sending sensitive information outside of the hospital.
