An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.
Explanation:
An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume provides persistent block storage that can be attached to an EC2 instance. An EBS volume is ideal for storing mission-critical data, such as the backup data in this case, because it provides high performance and durability.
Using Amazon S3 to store the backup data is also a good choice because it provides low-cost, scalable storage that can be easily accessed from anywhere. By configuring a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, you can optimize storage costs and free up space in S3 for new data.
Option (A) is not the best choice because instance store volumes are not recommended for storing mission-critical data. Instance store volumes are backed by the instance's main hard drive and do not provide the same level of durability as EBS volumes.
Option (C) is also not the best choice because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA does not offer the same level of performance and durability as Amazon S3 standard storage. While it may be a good option for some use cases, it is not the best choice for storing mission-critical data that requires high performance and durability.
Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not supported in EC2 instances.
