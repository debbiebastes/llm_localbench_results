A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
Explanation:
As the application starts to receive traffic at the beginning of the day, it experiences a spike in usage that can cause slow performance due to insufficient instance capacity. To address this issue, you can configure an Auto Scaling scheduled scaling policy to launch new instances before the start of the day. This will ensure that there are enough instances available to handle the increased traffic at the beginning of the day and prevent slow performance.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy is not the most operationally efficient solution because predictive scaling policies rely on historical data to forecast future usage, which can lead to inaccurate predictions during busy periods.
Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on memory utilization may also not be the best solution as it can lead to overprovisioning of instances, resulting in wasted resources and increased costs.
Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on CPU utilization is similar to option (B), and may also result in overprovisioning of instances.
