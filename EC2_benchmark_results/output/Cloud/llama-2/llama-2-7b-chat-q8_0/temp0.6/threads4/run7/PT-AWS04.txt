Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation: When resharding a data stream, the number of open shards must be evenly divisible by the number of worker instances. In this case, if you have six open shards and four KCL workers, you can launch up to six EC2 instances for optimal performance. Launching more than six instances will result in unused capacity and additional costs.
