A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:
This option is the most efficient because it leverages AWS Config, which is designed specifically for automating the configuration of resources across multiple accounts and regions. Using AWS Config, you can easily identify instances where developers have added rules to security groups without approval, and then automatically update those security groups with the corporate firewall IP address.
Option (B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances is not the best choice because it would require additional infrastructure and configuration, and may also introduce additional complexity and cost.
Option (C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because it would only block incoming traffic from the entire 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, without taking into account any other security considerations or potential mitigations.
Option (D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because it would only detect traffic allowed through security groups, without taking into account any other security considerations or potential mitigations.

Therefore, the best answer is (A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
