A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

The most cost-effective option would be (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option provides the best value for long-term commitments and can help you save up to 47% compared to On-Demand pricing over a 3-year period.
Here's why:
* All Upfront means that you pay the entire annual fee upfront, which can provide better savings than the other options.
* Standard Reserved Instance pricing provides more favorable pricing compared to Convertible Reserved Instances, especially for long-term commitments like 3 years.
* By committing to a 3-year term, you can take advantage of the lower prices offered by Standard Reserved Instances and avoid any price increases that may occur in the future.
So, if your application will be used for more than 3 years, it's the most cost-effective option to choose (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
