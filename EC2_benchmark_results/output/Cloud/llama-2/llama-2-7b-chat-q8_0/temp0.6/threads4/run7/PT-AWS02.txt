The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is option (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
In this scenario, the IT Security team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk by deploying patches to the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. Option (A) provides a quick solution by using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager to deploy the patches directly to the affected instances. This approach also integrates with Amazon QuickSight and Kibana, which can track any configuration changes made to the instances.
Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, which is a more complex solution that may take longer to implement. While this option does provide automatic patch management capabilities, it may not be as timely in addressing the immediate security risk.
Option (C) uses AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes, but it does not directly address the security vulnerability of the outdated operating systems.
Option (D) configures the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install patches on a weekly basis, which may be too infrequent in addressing the security risk. It also does not provide real-time monitoring and tracking capabilities like AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager.
