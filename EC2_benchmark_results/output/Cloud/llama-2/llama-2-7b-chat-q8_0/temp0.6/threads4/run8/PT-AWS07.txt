A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution would be (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
The issue of slow performance at the beginning of the day can be attributed to the instance startup time and the time it takes for the application to warm up. By configuring a Scheduled scaling policy, you can automatically launch new instances before the start of the day, which will help to reduce the delay in instance startup time and improve the overall performance of the application at the beginning of the day.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy is not the best solution as it would require historical data analysis to predict future usage patterns, which may not be accurate. Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy based on Memory utilization may also not be effective in addressing the issue as memory usage may not necessarily correlate with application performance. Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy based on CPU utilization is not relevant to this question.
