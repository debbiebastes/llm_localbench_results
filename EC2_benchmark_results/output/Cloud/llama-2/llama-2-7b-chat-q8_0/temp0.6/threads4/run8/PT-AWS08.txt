An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
An EBS volume provides block-level storage for an EC2 instance, and it is suitable for storing mission-critical workloads. By attaching an EBS volume to your EC2 instance, you can ensure that the data stored on it is highly available and durable.
Amazon S3 provides a scalable and durable object storage service that can be used to store backup data. You can configure a lifecycle policy in Amazon S3 to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which will provide long-term archiving and retrieval capabilities at a lower cost than storing the data in Amazon S3 Standard.
Amazon S3 Glacier provides a low-cost, durable, and secure cloud storage service for storing backup data that is unlikely to be accessed frequently. By storing your backup data in Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, you can reduce costs while still ensuring that the data is available for retrieval when needed.
Therefore, option (B) provides the best solution for meeting the organization's requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads and storing backup data in an object storage service with lifecycle management capabilities.
