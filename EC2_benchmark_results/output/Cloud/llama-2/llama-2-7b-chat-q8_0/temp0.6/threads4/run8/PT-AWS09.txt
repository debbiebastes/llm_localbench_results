A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
API Gateway provides several features that can help protect backend systems from traffic spikes, including throttling limits and caching. Throttling limits allow you to set limits on the number of requests that can be made to a resource within a certain time period. This can help prevent overload and ensure that no single user or client can flood the system with too many requests.
Caching can also help reduce traffic to backend systems by storing frequently accessed data in memory, rather than making repeated requests to the backend. When a request is made to an API, API Gateway can check its cache to see if the requested data is already available. If it is, the cached response can be returned instead of making a request to the backend.
Using throttling limits and caching in API Gateway can help ensure that the backend systems remain stable and responsive even during high traffic periods, such as those caused by rumors or news about a price surge in cryptocurrencies.
