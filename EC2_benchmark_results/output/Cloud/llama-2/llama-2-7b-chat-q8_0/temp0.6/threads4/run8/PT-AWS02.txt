The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
In this scenario, the IT Security team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk by deploying the patches to the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager provides a convenient way to automate the deployment of OS patches across multiple EC2 instances. By integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, the team can easily record and track any configuration changes related to the patch management process.
Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. However, this option does not provide a way to integrate with Amazon QuickSight or Kibana for tracking configuration changes.
Option (C) uses AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. However, it does not provide a way to automatically record and track any configuration changes related to the patch management process.
Option (D) configures the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis. While this option can help automate the patch management process, it may not provide real-time monitoring or tracking of configuration changes as required in this scenario.
