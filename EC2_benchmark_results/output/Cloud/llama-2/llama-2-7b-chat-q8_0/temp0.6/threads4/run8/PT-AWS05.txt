A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements.
EventBridge is a fully managed service that makes it easy to detect and react to changes in AWS services, including DynamoDB. By setting up an EventBridge rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, you can automatically capture new changes made to items in one table and save them to another table in another region.
Option (C) provides a scalable and flexible solution that meets the requirements of recording and storing all new changes made to items in DynamoDB. It also allows you to easily manage and monitor the process, as well as troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
