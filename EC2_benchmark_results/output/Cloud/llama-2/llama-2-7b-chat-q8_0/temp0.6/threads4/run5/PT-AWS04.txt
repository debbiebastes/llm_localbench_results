Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation:
When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards is increased, which means that each instance can process more data. To achieve optimum performance, you should launch the maximum number of EC2 instances equal to the number of open shards. In this case, since there are six open shards, you should launch a maximum of 6 EC2 instances.
Option (D) is the correct answer.
