An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The best answer is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Here's why:
Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes are designed for persistent storage and provide high throughput and IOPS for mission-critical workloads. They also support lifecycle policies, which allow you to automate the management of your data across different storage services based on predefined rules.
By attaching an EBS volume in your EC2 instance, you can store your backup data securely and persistently. You can then configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which provides a cost-effective archiving solution for long-term data retention.
Option (A) is not the best choice because instance store volumes are designed for short-term use and do not provide the same level of performance or durability as EBS volumes. Option (C) is also not the best choice because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a regional storage service, which may not provide the same level of availability or durability as Amazon S3 Glacier for long-term data retention.
Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are attached to the EC2 instance at launch time and cannot be changed after the instance is created.
