A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The most cost-effective option would be (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
Explanation:
If the application being hosted will be used for more than 3 years, it makes sense to go with a longer-term reserved instance to save on costs in the long run. Among the options provided, (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term offers the lowest hourly cost over the long term.
Option (A), All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term, would result in higher costs over the short term due to the lack of discounts for committing to a longer term. Option (B), No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term, would also result in higher costs than option (C) as there are no upfront discounts for not committing to a shorter term.
Option (D), No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year, would offer the lowest hourly cost over the short term but would result in higher costs overall due to the need to repeatedly commit to new 1-year terms.
