The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is option (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager allows you to easily manage and automate the patching process for your EC2 instances, ensuring that all instances are up-to-date and secure. This approach also provides a centralized location for tracking and managing patches, making it easier to demonstrate compliance with audit requirements.
Integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana allows you to visualize and track any changes made to the EC2 instances, providing a clear audit trail of all configuration changes. This approach also allows you to monitor and analyze your EC2 instance configurations in real-time, enabling you to quickly identify and address any security risks or compliance issues.
While options (B), (C), and (D) may also be suitable solutions, they are not as effective as option (A) in this scenario. Option (B) requires setting up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager separately, which may add additional complexity to the patching process. Option (C) involves using AWS Config, which may not provide the same level of automation and centralized management as AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Option (D) configures the EC2 instances to automatically install patches on a weekly basis, but does not provide real-time monitoring or auditing capabilities.
