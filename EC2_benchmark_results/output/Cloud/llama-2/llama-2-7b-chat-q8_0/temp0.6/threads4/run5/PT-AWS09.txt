A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:
API Gateway provides an option to enable throttling limits, which can help control the number of requests that are accepted from users within a certain time period. This feature can be especially useful during traffic spikes as it helps prevent overloading the backend systems with excessive requests. Additionally, API Gateway provides caching options, which can store frequently accessed data in memory or in an S3 bucket. This can help reduce the load on the backend systems by serving cached results instead of processing new requests for the same data.
Option (B) is the best answer as it addresses both the issues of traffic spikes and scalability. Enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway can help control the number of requests and reduce the load on the backend systems during periods of high traffic.
