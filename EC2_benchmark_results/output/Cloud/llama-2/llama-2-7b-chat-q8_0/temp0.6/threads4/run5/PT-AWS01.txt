A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.
Explanation:
The hospital requires that the sensitive PII data is stored in an encrypted form to comply with regulatory requirements, and client-side encryption is the best option for this use case. Client-side encryption allows the hospital's application to encrypt the data before it leaves its premises, ensuring that even AWS cannot access the unencrypted data.
Option (A) is incorrect because client-side master keys are not secure enough for this purpose. If the client-side master key is compromised, the attacker can access the encrypted data, which violates the hospital's security requirements.
Option (C) is also incorrect because server-side encryption does not provide adequate control over the encryption process. With server-side encryption, AWS manages the encryption and decryption processes, which may not meet the hospital's regulatory compliance requirements.
Option (D) is incorrect because customer provided keys are not secure enough for this purpose. The hospital must manage its own encryption keys to ensure that they are securely stored and managed. Using a customer-provided key would give AWS access to the key, which violates the hospital's security requirements.
