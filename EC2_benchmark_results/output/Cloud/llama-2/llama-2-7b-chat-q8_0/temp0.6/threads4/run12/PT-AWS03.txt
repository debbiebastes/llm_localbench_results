A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Explanation:
Option (A) uses AWS Config, which is a service that allows you to manage and automate the configuration of AWS resources. By creating an AWS Config rule, you can automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Once the rule detects such a security group, it can associate an Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is efficient because it automates the remediation process without requiring manual intervention.
Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances, which may not be the most efficient solution as it requires additional infrastructure and configuration.
Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, but this approach is not effective in remediating the security risk because it only blocks incoming traffic from the entire range of IP addresses, rather than specific security groups that allow traffic from that range.
Option (D) uses AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but this service is not designed for remediating security risks in security groups. It is primarily used for monitoring and protecting against DDoS attacks.

Therefore, option (A) is the most efficient way to automatically remediate the security risk of unauthorized access to sensitive resources through security groups.
