A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
To protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes, the best option is (B): Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
API Gateway provides an automatic scaling feature that can increase or decrease the number of instances handling incoming traffic based on the current load. This ensures that the system can handle sudden traffic spikes without crashing. Additionally, throttling limits can be set to prevent abuse of the service during high traffic periods, and result caching can be enabled to reduce the load on the backend systems by storing frequently requested data in memory.
While option (A) using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling is a more scalable architecture, it may not be necessary in this scenario as API Gateway provides similar functionality out of the box. Options (C) and (D) are not relevant to protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes.
