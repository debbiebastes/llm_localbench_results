An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The best answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.
Reason:

You need a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, so an EBS volume is the best option. An EBS volume provides high throughput and low latency, which is essential for mission-critical applications. Additionally, Amazon S3 is the recommended storage service for storing backup data, as it provides a highly durable and scalable storage solution.
Option (A) does not meet the requirement of using an EBS volume, as instance store volumes are volatile and do not provide the same level of durability as EBS volumes. Option (C) is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a suitable option for storing backup data, as it is designed for applications that require low latency and high throughput within a single Availability Zone.
Option (D) is also incorrect, as instance store volumes are not supported in the US East region.
