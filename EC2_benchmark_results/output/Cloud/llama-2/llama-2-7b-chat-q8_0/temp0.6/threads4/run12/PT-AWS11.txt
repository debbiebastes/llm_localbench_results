Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).
AWS Service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture is Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events). It allows you to collect and handle events generated by various sources, such as AWS services or custom applications, and route them to the appropriate microservices or functions. This enables you to create loosely coupled, resilient, and scalable architectures.

Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) is a message queue service that allows you to decouple components of your application architecture by sending messages between them. However, it does not provide the same level of event-driven functionality as Amazon EventBridge.
Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a fully managed messaging service that sends messages or push notifications to multiple subscribers or clients. It can be used for decoupling components of your application architecture, but it is primarily designed for sending notifications rather than handling events.
AWS Service that enables you to collect and process real-time data streams, such as IoT telemetry, log data, and application logs is Amazon Kinesis. However, it does not provide the same level of event-driven functionality as Amazon EventBridge.
