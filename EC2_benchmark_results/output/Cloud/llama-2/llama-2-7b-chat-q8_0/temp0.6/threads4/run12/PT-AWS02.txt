The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is option (B): Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
Why?
AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides a simple, automated way to manage patches on EC2 instances. With this service, you can easily deploy patches for outdated operating systems and ensure that your instances are up-to-date with the latest security fixes.
Option (B) also includes Amazon ES, which is an Elastic Search service that allows you to store, index, and search log data from various sources. This provides a centralized repository for tracking and monitoring any configuration changes.
Option (C) uses AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, but does not include a means of recording or tracking configuration changes.
Option (A) is partially correct, as it mentions using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager to deploy patches. However, it does not provide a centralized repository for tracking and monitoring configuration changes.
Option (D) is incorrect because it suggests configuring the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install patches on a weekly basis. While this may help ensure that patches are installed regularly, it does not provide a means of tracking or recording configuration changes.
