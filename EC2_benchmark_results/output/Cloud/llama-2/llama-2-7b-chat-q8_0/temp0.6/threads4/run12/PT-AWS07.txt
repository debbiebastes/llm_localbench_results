A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day is (C): Configuring a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
Explanation:
As the users are experiencing slow performance during the start of the day, it means that there is a high demand for instances during this time. By configuring a Scheduled scaling policy, you can automatically launch new instances before the start of the day, ensuring that there are enough resources available to handle the increased traffic. This will help ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day and reduces the likelihood of slow performance.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy is not the best solution as it relies on forecasting the future usage of instances, which can be inaccurate. Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on Memory utilization may not be effective as memory utilization may not be the only factor affecting performance during peak hours. Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on CPU utilization may also not be effective as it does not address the issue of slow performance at the beginning of the day.
