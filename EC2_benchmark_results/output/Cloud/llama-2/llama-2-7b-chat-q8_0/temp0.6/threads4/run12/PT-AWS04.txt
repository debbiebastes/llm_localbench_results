Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(D) 6

Explanation: When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards is increased. In this case, you have increased the number of open shards from 4 to 6. This means that each instance will have two KCL workers instead of one, which can handle more data throughput and lead to better performance.
To achieve optimum performance, you should launch a maximum of 6 EC2 instances, as each instance can handle 2 KCL workers, resulting in a total of 12 KCL workers processing the data stream. Therefore, option (D) 6 is the correct answer.
