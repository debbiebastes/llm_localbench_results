A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:
The correct answer is B, implementing Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach will ensure that the sensitive PII data is encrypted on the client-side using a KMS-managed key, and only the encrypted data is sent to AWS. The master key is never sent to AWS, which complies with the company's strict compliance and regulatory requirements.

The other options are not appropriate:

A) Implementing an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key would require the Security Engineer to manage and securely store the master key, which could be challenging and potentially less secure.

C) Implementing an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS-managed key would require AWS to have access to the master key, which is not desirable for compliance reasons.

D) Implementing an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key could be less secure as it would require the Security Engineer to manage and securely store the key, and there may be issues with key management and rotation.
