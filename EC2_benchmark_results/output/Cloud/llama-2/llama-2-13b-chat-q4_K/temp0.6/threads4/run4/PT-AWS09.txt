A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:

Option (A) is not the best choice because it would require significant changes to the existing architecture, which might not be feasible given the short notice of the expected traffic surge. Option (C) is not directly related to addressing the expected traffic spike and would only provide a caching layer. Option (D) does not address the issue of traffic spikes.

Option (B) enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway will help protect the backend systems from traffic spikes by limiting the number of requests that can be made to the Lambda function and caching the results of previous requests, respectively. This will help prevent the system from being overwhelmed by a sudden increase in traffic, ensuring that the backend systems remain stable and responsive even during periods of high traffic.

Therefore, option (B) is the best choice for protecting the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes.
