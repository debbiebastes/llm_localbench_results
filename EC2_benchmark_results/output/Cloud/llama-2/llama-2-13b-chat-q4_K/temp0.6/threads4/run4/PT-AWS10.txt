An e-commerce company wants to migrate its on-premise infrastructure to Amazon Web Services. However, they are worried about ensuring their migration is secure and efficient.

Which of the following AWS Cloud Adoption Framework perspective would be the most essential for the companyâ€™s migration?

(A) Security Perspective
(B) Governance Perspective
(C) Operations Perspective
(D) Platform Perspective

Answer: 

C) Operations Perspective.

The company needs to focus on ensuring their migration is efficient and seamless, which falls under the Operations Perspective of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework. This perspective involves planning and executing the migration, as well as optimizing the performance and scalability of the new infrastructure. While security and governance are also important considerations, they are better addressed from a long-term strategic perspective rather than during the immediate migration process.
