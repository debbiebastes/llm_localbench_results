A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

Correct Answer - (A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:

Option (A) is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk because it uses AWS Config rules to detect and remediate any security groups that allow traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range without approval. By associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule, the company can automatically update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is efficient because it does not require manual intervention and can be automated to run periodically to ensure that all security groups are properly configured.

Option (B) is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because setting up a Transit VPC would require additional infrastructure and configuration, which would be more time-consuming and costly than using AWS Config rules.

Option (C) would only partially address the issue by blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but it would not update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Option (D) is not a valid option because AWS Shield is not a service that can automatically monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.
