The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:

In this scenario, the main objective is to mitigate the security risk by deploying OS patches on the outdated EC2 instances as soon as possible. Therefore, using a solution that can easily deploy the patches and provide real-time tracking of configuration changes is essential.

Option (C) provides the most suitable solution for this scenario. By using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, the team can easily deploy the OS patches on the outdated EC2 instances. AWS Config can be used to record and track any configuration changes, providing real-time visibility into the compliance status of the instances.

Option (A) does not provide a straightforward solution for deploying patches and may require additional setup and integration with other tools. Option (B) is also not suitable since it does not provide real-time tracking of configuration changes. Option (D) is not appropriate since it does not address the immediate security risk and does not provide any real-time monitoring or reporting capabilities.
