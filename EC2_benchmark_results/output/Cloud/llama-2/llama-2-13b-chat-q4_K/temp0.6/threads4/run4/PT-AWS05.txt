A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

Option C is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements because it allows for real-time replication of new changes made to items in DynamoDB, without requiring manual intervention or additional infrastructure such as DynamoDB Accelerator or Point-in-Time Recovery.

Using Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) and a Lambda function allows for the real-time processing of table-level events in DynamoDB, such as inserts, updates, and deletes. The Lambda function can then save the new changes to the other DynamoDB table in another region.

Option A, setting up DynamoDB Accelerator, is not necessary for this use case as it only improves performance for read-heavy workloads and does not provide real-time replication. Option B, enabling Point-in-Time Recovery, would require manual intervention to trigger the recovery process and may not be suitable for real-time replication. Option D, using DynamoDB Streams, would also require manual intervention to set up and maintain the streams and Lambda function.
