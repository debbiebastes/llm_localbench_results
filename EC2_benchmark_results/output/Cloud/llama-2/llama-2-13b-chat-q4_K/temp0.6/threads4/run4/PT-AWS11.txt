Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Explanation:

Amazon EventBridge, previously known as Amazon CloudWatch Events, is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed event bus that allows you to communicate between services, applications, and microservices without having to worry about the complexity of implementing and managing your own messaging system. With EventBridge, you can easily integrate with other AWS services such as Lambda, SNS, SQS, and more, allowing for a loosely coupled architecture that is highly scalable and resilient.
