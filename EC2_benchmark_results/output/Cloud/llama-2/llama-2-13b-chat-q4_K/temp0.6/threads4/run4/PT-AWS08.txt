An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

Correct answer is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

To meet the requirement of a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, option (B) is the best choice. EBS (Elastic Block Store) volumes are designed for use cases that require persistent storage and are ideal for mission-critical workloads. They provide a highly available and durable storage solution that can be attached to EC2 instances.

Option (A) suggests using an instance store volume, which is not suitable for this requirement as it is intended for temporary storage needs. Option (C) suggests using Amazon S3 One Zone-IA, which is not a suitable choice for storing backup data. Option (D) also suggests using an instance store volume, which is not the best option for persistent block storage.

By attaching an EBS volume to your EC2 instance and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, you can ensure that your backup data is stored in a highly available and durable storage solution while also reducing costs by storing the data in Amazon S3 Glacier.
