A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:

The correct answer is option B, which offers the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO) over a 3-year period.

Here's why:

Option A, All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term, would require an upfront payment for the entire year, but this option provides the lowest hourly rate and is the most cost-effective for short-term usage.

Option C, All Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term, also requires an upfront payment for the entire 3-year period, but this option provides a higher hourly rate compared to Option A.

Option D, No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year, does not require any upfront payments but has the highest hourly rate among all options.

Since the application will be used for more than 3 years, Option B, which offers no upfront costs and provides a lower hourly rate compared to Options A and C, is the most cost-effective choice for the customer.
