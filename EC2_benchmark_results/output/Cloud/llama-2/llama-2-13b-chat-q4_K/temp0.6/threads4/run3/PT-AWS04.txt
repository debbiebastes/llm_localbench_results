Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

To achieve optimum performance, each KCL worker can process one shard concurrently. With six open shards, you should launch at least three EC2 instances (to process six shards simultaneously). Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3.
