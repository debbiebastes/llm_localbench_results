The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:

Option C is the most suitable solution in this scenario because it allows for easy deployment of OS patches using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, while also providing a centralized way to record and track any configuration changes using AWS Config. This approach ensures that all EC2 instances are up-to-date with the latest security patches, and provides detailed audit logs of all changes made to the configurations.

Option A is not suitable because it requires manual intervention to integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, which may not be feasible or scalable for large environments.

Option B is not suitable because AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager is a more comprehensive solution that can handle a wide range of OS patches and configurations, while Amazon ES is primarily used for log management.

Option D is not suitable because it does not address the need for audit logs and compliance tracking.
