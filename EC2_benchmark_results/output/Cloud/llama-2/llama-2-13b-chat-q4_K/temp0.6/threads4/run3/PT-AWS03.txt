A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

Correct answer is (A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Explanation:

Option A is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk because it uses AWS Config, which is designed specifically for automating and managing AWS resources. By using AWS Config rules to detect security groups that allow inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, you can automatically identify and remediate the security risk.

Option B is not the best choice because setting up a Transit VPC would require significant changes to the company's infrastructure and would not address the specific security risk of allowing traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Option C is also not the best choice because blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACLs would block all incoming traffic, which could have unintended consequences and may not be feasible in a production environment.

Option D is not the correct answer because AWS Shield is designed to provide DDoS protection and security monitoring for Amazon Elastic Cloud 2 (EC2) instances and does not have the capability to automatically remediate security risks.

Therefore, using AWS Config rules to automatically detect and remediate security groups that allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is the most efficient way to address this security risk.
