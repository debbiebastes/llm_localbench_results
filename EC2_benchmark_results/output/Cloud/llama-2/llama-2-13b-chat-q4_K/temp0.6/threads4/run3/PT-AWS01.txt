A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:

To ensure that the sensitive PII data is never sent to AWS, the Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption using a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach will allow the hospital to manage the encryption keys on their own premises, while still leveraging the scalability and reliability of AWS.

Option (A) would require the hospital to manage the encryption keys on their own, which may not be feasible or secure for sensitive data. Option (C) would encrypt data only on the server-side, which would not meet the requirements of never sending sensitive data to AWS. Option (D) would allow the hospital to provide their own encryption key, but this could introduce security risks if the key is compromised or not properly managed.

Therefore, option (B) is the best choice for the Security Engineer to ensure that the sensitive PII data is securely stored in AWS while never being sent to AWS.
