An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

Correct answer is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

* An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume provides persistent storage for an EC2 instance, which is suitable for mission-critical workloads.
* Using Amazon S3 to store backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier will provide long-term storage at a lower cost.
* Option (A) using an instance store volume is not suitable for mission-critical workloads as it is only available on certain EC2 instances and is not designed for persistent storage.
* Option (C) using Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not relevant to the requirement of long-term storage at a lower cost.
* Option (D) using an instance store volume in combination with Amazon S3 is not suitable as it would require additional complexity and management.
