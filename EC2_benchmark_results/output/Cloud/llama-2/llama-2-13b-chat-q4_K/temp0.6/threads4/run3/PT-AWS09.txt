A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:
API Gateway can help protect backend systems from traffic spikes by enabling throttling limits, which control the rate at which requests are sent to the backend. This can prevent the backend from being overwhelmed with too many requests at once. Additionally, API Gateway can cache results, so that frequently requested data does not have to be retrieved from the backend every time it is requested, reducing the load on the backend.

Option A is not a good solution because EC2 instances and Auto Scaling are not designed to handle sudden traffic spikes. Option C is also not a good solution as CloudFront is a content delivery network and does not provide throttling or caching features. Option D does not make sense in this scenario.
