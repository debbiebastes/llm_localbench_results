A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Correct answer: A

Rationale: The given solution is the most efficient way to automatically remediate the security risk. Using AWS Config rules, you can detect any security groups that allow inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range and update them with the corporate firewall IP address using a Systems Manager Automation document associated with an AWS Lambda function. This approach is more efficient than setting up a Transit VPC (Option B), blocking source IP addresses using Network ACLs (Option C), or relying on AWS Shield to detect security groups (Option D).

By automating the remediation process, you can ensure that all security groups are updated with the correct firewall IP address, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to your resources.
