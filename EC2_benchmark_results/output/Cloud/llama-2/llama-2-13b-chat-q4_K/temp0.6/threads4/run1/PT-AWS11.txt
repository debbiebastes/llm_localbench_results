Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed events bus that allows you to communicate between services, applications, and microservices without needing to worry about the underlying infrastructure. With EventBridge, you can easily integrate with other AWS services, such as Lambda functions, Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, and more.
