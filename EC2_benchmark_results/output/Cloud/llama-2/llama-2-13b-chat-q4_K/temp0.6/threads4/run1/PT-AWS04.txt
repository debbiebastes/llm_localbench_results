Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

B

Rationale:

The maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance is 12. This is because each instance can process one shard, and with six open shards, you need 6 instances to process all the data. Launching more instances beyond this point will not improve performance as each instance has a fixed amount of resources and capacity to process the data. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
