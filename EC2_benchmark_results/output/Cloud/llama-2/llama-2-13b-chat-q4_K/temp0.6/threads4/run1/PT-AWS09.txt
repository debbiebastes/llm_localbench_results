A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

B

Explanation:
Enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway would help protect the backend systems from traffic spikes by limiting the number of requests that can be made to the system within a certain time frame, and storing the results of previous requests in memory so that they don't have to be recomputed. This can help reduce the load on the backend systems and prevent them from becoming overwhelmed during periods of high traffic.
