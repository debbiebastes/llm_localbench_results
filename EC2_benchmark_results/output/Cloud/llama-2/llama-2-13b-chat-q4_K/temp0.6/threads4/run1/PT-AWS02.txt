The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the company’s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Rationale:

Option A is not suitable because it does not provide a straightforward solution for patching the EC2 instances and tracking compliance statuses.

Option B is not suitable because it does not include a mechanism for recording and tracking configuration changes.

Option D is not suitable because it does not address the immediate security risk and does not provide a way to track compliance statuses.

Option C is the most suitable solution because it allows for easy patching of the EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, and provides a way to record and track configuration changes using AWS Config. This approach ensures that the company’s applications are safeguarded from cyber security attacks, while also providing an audit trail of all changes and compliance statuses.
