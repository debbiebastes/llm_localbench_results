A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
(B) Configure a dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the memory utilization.

Rationale:
The issue is with the performance of the application during the start of the day, which suggests that the application is experiencing high traffic and memory usage during this time. Configuring a dynamic scaling policy based on memory utilization will allow the Auto Scaling group to launch additional instances as needed to handle the increased demand and ensure that the application performs optimally during the start of the day.

Note: The other options do not address the specific issue of high traffic and memory usage during the start of the day, and may not be effective in resolving the problem.
