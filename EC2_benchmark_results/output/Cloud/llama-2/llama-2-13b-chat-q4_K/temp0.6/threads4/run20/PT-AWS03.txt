A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Correct Answer: A. Using AWS Config rules to automatically detect and remediate security groups that allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is the most efficient way to address this security risk. By associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function, the system can automatically update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address, ensuring that only authorized traffic is allowed inbound. This approach eliminates the need for manual configuration and monitoring, reducing the likelihood of human error and improving overall security.

Other options do not address the root cause of the issue effectively:

B. Setting up a Transit VPC would require additional infrastructure setup and maintenance, and may not be necessary if the corporate firewall is already in place.

C. Blocking source IP addresses using Network ACLs might not be effective in this case since it would block all traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, including legitimate traffic that should be allowed.

D. Using AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups allowing traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is not a proactive solution and would only provide alerts after the fact.
