An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

An Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume is a block-level storage volume that is persistently attached to an EC2 instance, providing a highly available and durable storage solution. Therefore, option B is the best choice for storing backup data.

Option A uses an instance store volume, which is not suitable for storing backup data because it is tied to the instance and cannot be detached or moved. Option C stores the backup data in Amazon S3 One Zone-IA, which is a less expensive storage class but may not provide the same level of durability as Amazon S3 Glacier. Option D is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for storing backup data.

By attaching an EBS volume and using Amazon S3 to store the backup data, you can ensure that your backup data is persistently stored and available even if your EC2 instance fails or is terminated. Additionally, by configuring a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, you can reduce storage costs for older backups.
