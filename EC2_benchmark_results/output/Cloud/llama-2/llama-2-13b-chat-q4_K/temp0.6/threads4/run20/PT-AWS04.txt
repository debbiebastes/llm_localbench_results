Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

The maximum number of EC2 instances that you can launch to achieve optimum performance is 12.

Since you have six shards, each instance can process one shard, and you will need six instances to process all the shards. However, since you want to maintain redundancy and availability, it's recommended to launch two more instances as a failover and load balancing mechanism. Therefore, the maximum number of instances that you should launch is 12 (6 for processing shards + 2 for redundancy and load balancing).
