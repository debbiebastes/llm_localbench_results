A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances.

Explanation:

The best option is to configure a predictive scaling policy, which can anticipate the increased demand during the start of the day and adjust the number of instances accordingly. This approach ensures that the application has enough resources to handle the expected increase in traffic without overprovisioning or underprovisioning instances.

Predictive scaling policies use historical data and machine learning algorithms to forecast future usage patterns and adjust the instance count accordingly. The policy can be trained on historical usage data, such as daily or weekly usage patterns, to predict the expected traffic during the start of the day.

In contrast, dynamic scaling based on CPU or memory utilization may not be effective in this scenario because it only reacts to current conditions and may not anticipate future demand. Scheduled scaling, which launches new instances before the start of the day, may also not be necessary if the predictive scaling policy can accurately forecast the expected traffic.

Therefore, option (A) is the most operationally efficient solution to ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day.
