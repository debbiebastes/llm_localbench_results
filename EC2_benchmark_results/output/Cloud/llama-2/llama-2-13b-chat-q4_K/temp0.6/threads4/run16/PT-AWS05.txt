A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:
This option is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements because it allows for real-time tracking of changes made to the items in DynamoDB, and automates the process of saving those changes to another table.

Option A (Set up DynamoDB Accelerator) does not address the requirement of recording changes in another region.

Option B (Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables) may not be suitable for this use case as it is primarily designed for disaster recovery, and may not provide real-time updates.

Option D (Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table) would require additional setup and maintenance compared to using Amazon EventBridge.
