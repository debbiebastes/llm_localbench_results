An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B. Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Option B is the correct answer because it meets all the requirements of the scenario:

1. Persistent block storage volume: An EBS volume provides persistent block-level storage, which is suitable for mission-critical workloads.
2. Backup data stored in S3: Amazon S3 is a highly durable and scalable object storage service that can store large amounts of backup data.
3. Lifecycle policy to transition objects to Glacier: A lifecycle policy can be configured to move older data to Amazon S3 Glacier, which provides long-term archival storage at a lower cost.

Option A is not the correct answer because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads and do not provide persistent block-level storage. Option C is also not the correct answer because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not designed for long-term archival storage, and the data would not be transitioned to a more cost-effective storage tier after 30 days. Option D is not the correct answer because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads and do not provide persistent block-level storage.
