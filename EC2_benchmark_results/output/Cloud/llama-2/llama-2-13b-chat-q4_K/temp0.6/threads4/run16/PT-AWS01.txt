A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:
To comply with the strict regulations and compliance requirements of the hospital, the Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key for storing sensitive PII data in S3. This approach ensures that the master keys are never sent to AWS, as they remain on the client side and only used to encrypt the data before it's uploaded to S3. Additionally, using a KMS-managed key provides an added layer of security and control over access to the encryption keys, which is essential for maintaining confidentiality and integrity of sensitive patient information.
