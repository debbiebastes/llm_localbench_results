A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B. No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:

The most cost-effective option would be to choose the No Upfront, Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option allows you to pay hourly for the usage of the instance and provides flexibility in case your usage patterns change over time.

Option A, All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term, would require a large upfront payment and may not be cost-effective if the application is only used for more than 3 years.

Option C, All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term, also requires a large upfront payment and does not provide flexibility in case of usage changes.

Option D, No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year, would result in higher costs over 3 years as you would be paying hourly for the usage of the instance and also incurring additional costs for renewal each year.
