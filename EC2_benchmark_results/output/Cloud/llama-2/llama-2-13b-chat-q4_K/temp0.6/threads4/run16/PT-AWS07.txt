A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

B

Rationale: 
Option B is the most operationally efficient solution to ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day. Launching new instances based on Memory utilization will allow for more instances to be available during peak usage times, such as at the start of the day when users are more likely to be accessing the application simultaneously. This will help to alleviate performance issues and ensure that the application can handle the increased traffic without any slowdowns or downtime.

Note: This is a multiple choice question, so you need to select one option as the best answer.
