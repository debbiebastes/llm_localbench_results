Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12

Explanation:

To achieve optimum performance, the number of EC2 instances should be at least twice the number of open shards. In this case, there are six open shards, so the minimum number of EC2 instances required would be 6 x 2 = 12. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer.

Note: The actual number of instances required may vary depending on other factors such as the type of instance and the specific requirements of your application.
