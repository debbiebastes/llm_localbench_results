A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:

Option (A) is not a good choice because it would require significant changes to the existing architecture, which may not be feasible given the time constraints. Option (C) is also not a good choice as CloudFront is not designed for caching of API Gateway responses.

Option (D) does not address the issue of traffic spikes and would not provide any performance benefits.

Option (B) is the best choice because it allows you to control the number of requests that can be made to the Lambda function, and also cache the results of previous requests to reduce the load on the backend systems. This will help protect the backend systems from traffic spikes and ensure that they remain available and responsive even under high loads.

Note: The correct answer is based on the assumption that the platform is using AWS Lambda and API Gateway, and that the goal is to protect the backend systems from traffic spikes while maintaining availability and responsiveness. If the platform uses different technologies or has different requirements, other options may be more appropriate.
