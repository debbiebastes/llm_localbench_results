A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
A" Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address."

Explanation:
Option A is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk because it uses AWS Config rules to detect and remediate any security groups that allow traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which is the source of the security risk. By associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule, the solution can automatically update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address, effectively blocking any traffic from unknown sources.

Option B is not the best choice because setting up a Transit VPC would not directly address the security risk posed by the unapproved security groups.

Option C is not the best choice because blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL would only block traffic at the network level, and may not be effective in remediating the security risk if the developers have already added rules to allow traffic from unknown sources.

Option D is not the best choice because AWS Shield is a security service that provides protection against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, but it does not provide real-time monitoring and detection of security groups that allow traffic from unknown sources.
