A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

B

Rationale: The problem is that the application performance is slow during the start of the day, which suggests that the demand for resources is higher during this time. By configuring a dynamic scaling policy based on memory utilization, the Auto Scaling group will launch new instances as needed to handle the increased demand. This approach is more operationally efficient than predictive scaling or scheduled scaling because it responds immediately to changes in resource utilization. Additionally, using memory utilization as the scaling metric is a good choice because it is a good indicator of application performance.

Note: The correct answer is not (A) Predictive Scaling, because it would not be able to handle the sudden spike in demand during the start of the day. Also, not (C) Scheduled Scaling, as it would not be able to respond to changes in resource utilization in real-time. And not (D) Dynamic Scaling based on CPU utilization, because it may not be the best indicator of application performance.
