Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

AWS EventBridge is a fully managed service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a centralized platform for handling events generated by various AWS services, custom applications, and SaaS integrations. With EventBridge, you can create rules to route events between different components of your application, enabling loosely coupled architectures and microservices-based designs.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queue service that enables you to decouple components of your application by using queues to pass messages between them. However, it does not provide the same level of event management features as EventBridge.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a messaging service that sends messages or push notifications to multiple subscribers or clients. While it can be used for decoupling components of your application, it is primarily designed for sending notifications rather than managing events.

Amazon Kinesis is a fully managed streaming service that enables you to build real-time data streaming applications. While it can be used for decoupling components of your application, its primary use case is for processing large streams of data in real-time.
