The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the company’s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Rationale: Option C is the most suitable solution as it provides an efficient way to deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, which can automatically download, install, and deploy patches across multiple instances. Additionally, option C allows for the recording and tracking of configuration changes using AWS Config, which provides a centralized view of the company’s AWS resources and their associated compliance statuses. This provides an effective solution to mitigate the security risk and ensure compliance with various cybersecurity standards.

Option A is not suitable as it does not provide an efficient way to deploy patches across multiple instances. Option B is not suitable as it requires additional setup and integration of Amazon ES, which may not be necessary in this scenario. Option D is not suitable as it does not provide a centralized view of the company’s AWS resources and their associated compliance statuses.
