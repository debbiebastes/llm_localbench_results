An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B

Rationale: Option B is the best choice because EBS (Elastic Block Store) is a block-level storage volume that is optimized for mission-critical workloads, and it provides persistent storage that can be attached to an EC2 instance. Option A is not suitable because instance store volumes are not designed for long-term storage and may not be reliable enough for mission-critical workloads.

Option C is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a storage class that provides infrequent access to data, which may not meet the requirement of storing backup data for 30 days.

Option D is incorrect because instance store volumes are not designed for long-term storage and may not be reliable enough for mission-critical workloads.
