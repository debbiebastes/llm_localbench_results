A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Correct answer: (A)

Explanation:

Option A is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk because it uses AWS Config rules to detect and update the security groups that allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, without requiring manual intervention. By associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule, the remediation can be automated and executed quickly.

Option B is not the best choice because setting up a Transit VPC would not directly address the security risk of allowing traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Option C is not the best choice because blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACLs would also block legitimate traffic, and would not provide a flexible and scalable solution.

Option D is not relevant to this scenario as AWS Shield is a premium security service that provides DDoS protection and threat detection, but it does not have the capability to automatically remediate security risks like the one described in this question.
