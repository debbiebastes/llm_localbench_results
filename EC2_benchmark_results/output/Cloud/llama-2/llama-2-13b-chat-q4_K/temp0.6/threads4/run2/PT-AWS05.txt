A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:
EventBridge (formerly known as CloudWatch Events) is ideal for tracking table-level events, such as creates, updates, and deletes on DynamoDB tables. By setting up an EventBridge rule that triggers a Lambda function for new changes, you can ensure that all new items in the source table are recorded and stored in the target table in another region. This solution also allows for fine-grained control over which events are captured and processed by the Lambda function.

Option (A) is not relevant to this use case, as DynamoDB Accelerator only improves the performance of DynamoDB tables for applications that use it.

Option (B) would require enabling Point-in-Time Recovery on both tables, which might not be necessary if you only want to capture new changes made to the source table. Additionally, this option would require more complex setup and maintenance compared to EventBridge.

Option (D) is also not ideal, as DynamoDB Streams are designed for real-time stream processing and might not be suitable for this use case, which only requires capturing new changes made to the source table.
