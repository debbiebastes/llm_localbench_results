A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:

The best approach for securing sensitive data in AWS is to use client-side encryption, where the sensitive data is encrypted on the client-side before it is sent to AWS. This ensures that the data remains protected even if the data is intercepted or accessed by unauthorized users.

In this case, the Security Engineer should implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This will ensure that the sensitive PII data is encrypted on the client-side using a customer-managed key, which is stored in AWS Key Management Service (KMS). The encrypted data will then be stored in the Amazon S3 bucket.

Option A is incorrect because it uses a client-side master key, which may not provide adequate security for sensitive data. Option C is incorrect because it uses a server-side encryption, which may not provide adequate control over the encryption process. Option D is incorrect because it uses a customer-provided key, which may not be secure enough.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B, which provides a secure and compliant solution for storing sensitive PII data in AWS.
