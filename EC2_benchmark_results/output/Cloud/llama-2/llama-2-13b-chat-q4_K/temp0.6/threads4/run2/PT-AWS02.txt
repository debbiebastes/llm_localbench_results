The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
C

Rationale: Of the options given, option C is the most suitable solution because it allows for easy deployment of OS patches using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, and also records and tracks any configuration changes using AWS Config. This provides the necessary security mitigation while also ensuring compliance requirements are met for audit purposes.

Option A does not provide a complete solution as it does not address the requirement to track and record configuration changes. Option B is not the best choice as it uses Amazon ES which is not ideal for tracking and recording configuration changes. Option D does not address the immediate security risk, and instead automates patch installation on a weekly basis which may not be sufficient in this scenario.
