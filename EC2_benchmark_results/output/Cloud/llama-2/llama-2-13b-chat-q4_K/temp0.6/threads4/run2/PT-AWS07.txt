A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

Answer: C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation: 

The users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day, indicating that there may be insufficient resources (e.g., CPU and memory) to handle the increased traffic at the beginning of the day. To address this issue, a Scheduled scaling policy can be configured for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day to ensure that there are enough resources available to handle the increased traffic during peak hours.

Option A (Predictive scaling) is not the most operationally efficient solution in this case as it relies on historical data to predict future usage patterns and may not be effective in addressing immediate spikes in traffic.

Option B (Dynamic scaling based on Memory utilization) is also not the most operationally efficient solution as memory utilization may not be the best indicator of the needed resources at the start of the day when there may be a sudden increase in traffic.

Option D (Dynamic scaling based on CPU utilization) may help but it's not the most efficient way to handle this issue as it can lead to over-provisioning of instances and increased costs.
