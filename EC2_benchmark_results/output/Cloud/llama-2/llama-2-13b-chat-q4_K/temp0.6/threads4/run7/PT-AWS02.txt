The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation: The best solution is option C, which involves using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances and setting up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes. This approach provides a centralized way to manage patching across multiple instances and ensures that all changes are recorded and tracked for audit purposes.

Option A is not suitable because it does not provide a centralized solution for patch management, and integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana may not be necessary for this use case. Option B is also not the best choice since AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides more features than AWS ES for patch management. Finally, option D is not a suitable solution because it does not provide a way to track and record configuration changes.
