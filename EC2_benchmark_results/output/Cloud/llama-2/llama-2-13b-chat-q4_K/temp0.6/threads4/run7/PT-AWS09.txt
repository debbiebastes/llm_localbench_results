A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:

When there is a sudden surge in traffic, it can be challenging for the backend systems to handle the increased load. To protect the backend systems from traffic spikes, you should enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Throttling limits help regulate the number of requests that can be made within a specific time frame, preventing overload on the backend systems. Result caching allows frequently requested data to be stored in memory, reducing the load on the backend systems.

Using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling (Option A) may also be effective, but it requires more resources and setup time. CloudFront (Option C) can act as a cache, but it is not designed for throttling limits and result caching. Moving the Lambda function to a VPC (Option D) does not provide any protection from traffic spikes.
