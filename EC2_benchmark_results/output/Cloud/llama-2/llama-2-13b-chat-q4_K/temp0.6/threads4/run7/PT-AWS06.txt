A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation: When an API Gateway proxy integration fails with a 502 Bad Gateway error, it typically means that the backend service (in this case, the Lambda function) returned an incompatible output or an error that prevented the API Gateway from properly processing the request. Since the developer was able to invoke the underlying function and receive a proper result in XML format, it suggests that the issue is with the output format or content of the Lambda function's response rather than the invocation itself. Therefore, option (A) is the most likely root cause of this issue.
