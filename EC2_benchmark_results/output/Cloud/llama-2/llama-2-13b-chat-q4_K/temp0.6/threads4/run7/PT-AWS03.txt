A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:

Option A is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk as it allows for real-time detection of security groups that allow traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and automatic remediation by updating the security group with the corporate firewall IP address using AWS Config rules and Systems Manager Automation documents. This approach also leverages AWS services such as AWS Lambda and Systems Manager to automatically detect and remediate security risks without requiring manual intervention.

Option B is not relevant to this scenario, as Transit VPCs are used for connecting multiple VPCs across different regions, and do not provide the necessary functionality for remediating security risks.

Option C would only block traffic from the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but would not update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. Additionally, Network ACLs are not as flexible and scalable as AWS Config rules and Systems Manager Automation documents.

Option D is a feature of AWS Shield that provides automated security monitoring and detection of security risks, but it does not provide real-time remediation capabilities like AWS Config rules and Systems Manager Automation documents.
