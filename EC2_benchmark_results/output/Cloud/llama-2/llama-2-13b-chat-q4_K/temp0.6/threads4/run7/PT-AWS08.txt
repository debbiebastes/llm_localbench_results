An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:
Option (B) is the correct answer because it meets all the requirements mentioned in the question.

1. Persistent storage volume: An EBS volume provides persistent storage that will be available even after the EC2 instance is terminated or restarted.
2. Mission-critical workloads: EBS volumes are suitable for mission-critical workloads because they provide a highly available and durable storage solution.
3. Backup data in S3: Amazon S3 can store the backup data, and a lifecycle policy can be configured to transition the objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days.
4. Data archiving: After 30 days, the data can be stored in a data archiving storage service, such as Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.

Option (A) is incorrect because an instance store volume is not persistent and will be lost when the EC2 instance is terminated or restarted. Option (C) is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a suitable storage solution for mission-critical workloads. Option (D) is incorrect because it does not provide a persistent storage volume.
