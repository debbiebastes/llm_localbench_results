A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:

The best option for the hospital's requirements is to use client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key (Option B). This approach ensures that the sensitive data remains encrypted even when it is stored in AWS. The KMS manages the master key, which is never sent to AWS, and only the client-side has access to the encryption key. This means that the hospital can maintain control over its sensitive data and comply with its strict regulatory requirements.

Option A uses a client-side master key, which can be less secure as it may be stored on the client's device, potentially exposed to malware or other attacks. Option C uses server-side encryption, which means that AWS manages the encryption and decryption of the data, but this approach requires the hospital to provide AWS with its encryption keys, defeating the purpose of maintaining control over sensitive data. Option D allows customer-provided keys, but it may not meet regulatory requirements for sensitive data storage.
