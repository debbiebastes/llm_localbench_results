A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. 

Explanation: The No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing option offers the lowest total cost over a 3-year period, since there is no upfront payment required and the hourly usage rate is lower than the other options. The Convertible Reserved Instance allows for flexibility in case the instance usage changes over time.

Which of the following is NOT a benefit of using a Reserved Instance?

(A) Lower hourly usage rates compared to On-Demand instances.
(B) No upfront payment required.
(C) Flexibility to change instance types or regions as needed.
(D) Discounts for committed usage over a 1-year term.

Answer:

(D) Discounts for committed usage over a 1-year term.

Explanation: Reserved Instances do not offer discounts for committed usage over a 1-year term. Instead, they offer a lower hourly usage rate compared to On-Demand instances and the flexibility to change instance types or regions as needed.
