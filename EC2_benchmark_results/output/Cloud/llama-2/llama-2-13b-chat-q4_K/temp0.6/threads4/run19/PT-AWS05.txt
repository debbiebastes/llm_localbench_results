A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

Option C is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements because it leverages Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as CloudWatch Events) to track table-level events in DynamoDB and trigger a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach has several advantages:

1. Scalability: EventBridge can handle large volumes of events, ensuring that the processing of new changes is scalable and reliable.
2. Ease of setup: With EventBridge, you don't need to create a separate Lambda function or set up complex triggers; instead, you can simply define the event patterns and rule targets.
3. Flexibility: You can configure multiple rule targets, allowing you to process changes in multiple tables or perform different actions based on the same events.
4. Cost-effective: Since EventBridge is a pay-per-request service, you only pay for the events that are processed, making it a cost-effective solution compared to other options.

While Option D (Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function) could also work, it requires more setup and maintenance, as you would need to create a separate Lambda function and set up stream processing. Additionally, DynamoDB Streams can generate a lot of events, which can lead to increased costs and complexity.

Option A (Set up DynamoDB Accelerator) is not relevant in this scenario, as it only provides performance optimizations for certain types of read operations.

Option B (Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery) is not the best choice, as it only allows you to restore the entire table to a specific point in time, which may not be necessary or efficient for this use case.
