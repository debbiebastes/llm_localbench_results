A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

A) Using AWS Config rules and Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk.

Explanation:

The given security risk can be mitigated by updating the security groups to only allow traffic from the corporate firewall IP address, instead of allowing traffic from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0). Using AWS Config rules and Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function provides a centralized and automated approach to detect and remediate such security risks.

Option B is not relevant as it only provides a VPC-based solution and does not address the security risk directly.

Option C is also not relevant as it only blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but does not update the security groups to allow only traffic from the corporate firewall IP address.

Option D is a security feature that provides additional security features such as DDoS protection and SQL injection detection, but it does not provide a direct solution for mitigating the given security risk.
