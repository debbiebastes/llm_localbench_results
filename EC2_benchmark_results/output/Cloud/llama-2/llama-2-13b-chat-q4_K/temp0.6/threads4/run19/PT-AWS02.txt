The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Rationale:

The best solution in this scenario is option C, which involves using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances and setting up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes. This approach allows for easy deployment of patches across multiple instances and provides a centralized view of compliance statuses.

AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides a streamlined way to manage OS patching, allowing you to automate the process and ensure that all instances are up-to-date with the latest security updates. By integrating AWS Config, you can track changes and maintain a complete audit trail of all configuration changes, which is essential for compliance purposes.

Option A is not suitable because it does not provide a centralized solution for patch management. Option B is not suitable because it does not offer the ability to track configuration changes. Option D is not suitable because it does not address the need for centralized patch management and compliance tracking.
