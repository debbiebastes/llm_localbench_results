A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:

The best approach for encrypting sensitive PII data in an Amazon S3 bucket would be to use client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach ensures that the sensitive data is encrypted on the client-side before being sent to AWS, and the master key is never sent to AWS.

Option (A) does not provide a secure solution as it relies on the client-side master key, which may be compromised or leaked. Option (C) and (D) do not meet the requirement of never sending the master keys to AWS.

Therefore, option (B) is the most appropriate choice for this scenario.
