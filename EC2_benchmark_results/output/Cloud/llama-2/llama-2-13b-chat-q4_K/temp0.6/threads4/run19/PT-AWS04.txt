Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(D) 6

Explanation: When you reshard your Kinesis data stream to increase the number of open shards from four to six, each instance can still process only one shard. Therefore, launching 6 EC2 instances will allow each instance to process one shard, resulting in optimal performance. Launching more than 6 instances would not provide better performance as each instance would still be processing only one shard.
