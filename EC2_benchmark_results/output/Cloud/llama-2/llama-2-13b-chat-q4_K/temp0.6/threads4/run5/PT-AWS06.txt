A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 

A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation: A 502 Bad Gateway error typically indicates that there is an issue with the server that is acting as a gateway to the resource being requested. In this case, the API Gateway is serving as the gateway to the Lambda function, and the error is indicating that the output from the Lambda function is not in a format that is compatible with the API Gateway. This suggests that the issue is likely related to the output of the Lambda function, rather than the endpoint request timing out (option B) or occasional out-of-order invocations due to heavy loads (option C). The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy being invalid (option D) is not a likely cause of this issue.
