A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.  

Explanation: The correct answer is option B, which states that the Security Engineer should implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach meets the requirements of never sending the master keys or the unencrypted data to AWS. By using a KMS-managed customer master key, the encryption and decryption are done entirely on the client side, ensuring that sensitive data is never stored in plaintext in AWS.

Option A is incorrect because it requires the client-side master key, which may not be secure as it can be easily compromised if the client's machine is breached. Option C is incorrect because it requires the server-side encryption and the unencrypted data will still be stored in AWS, which violates the requirement of never sending sensitive data to AWS. Option D is incorrect because customer provided key may not meet the compliance requirements of the company.
