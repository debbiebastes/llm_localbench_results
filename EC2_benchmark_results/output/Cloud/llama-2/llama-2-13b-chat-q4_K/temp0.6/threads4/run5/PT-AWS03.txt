A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.

Correct! By setting up a transit VPC, you can route all traffic from the EC2 instances through the corporate firewall, thereby automatically blocking any unauthorized inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. This approach is more efficient than manually updating each security group or using AWS Config rules to detect and remediate the issue.

Option A is not the most efficient way to remediate the security risk because it requires creating an AWS Lambda function and associating it with an AWS Config rule, which can be time-consuming and may not provide real-time detection and remediation.

Option C is not the best approach because network ACLs are not designed to block traffic based on source IP addresses. They are used to control traffic at the network layer, not at the application layer.

Option D is not relevant to this scenario because AWS Shield is a security service that provides DDoS protection and advanced threat protection, but it does not provide real-time detection and remediation of security group configurations.
