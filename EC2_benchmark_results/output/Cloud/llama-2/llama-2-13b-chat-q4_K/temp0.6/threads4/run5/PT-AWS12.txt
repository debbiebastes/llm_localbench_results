A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B. No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation: 

The No Upfront, Convertible Reserved Instance option provides the lowest total cost over a 3-year period. With this option, you pay nothing upfront and have the flexibility to convert your Reserved Instances to On-Demand instances as needed. The hourly usage charges for the Reserved Instances are lower than the On-Demand instance pricing, which will result in significant cost savings over the 3-year period.

Here's a breakdown of the costs:

Year 1:

* No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance: $0 upfront, $12,000 per year (hourly usage charges) = $12,000
* All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance: $3,000 upfront, $12,000 per year (hourly usage charges) = $15,000

Year 2 and Year 3:

* No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance: $0 upfront, $12,000 per year (hourly usage charges) = $12,000
* All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance: $3,000 upfront, $12,000 per year (hourly usage charges) = $15,000

Total cost over 3 years:

* No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance: $12,000 + $12,000 + $12,000 = $36,000
* All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance: $15,000 + $15,000 + $15,000 = $45,000

As you can see, the No Upfront, Convertible Reserved Instance option provides a total cost savings of $9,000 over the 3-year period compared to the All Upfront, Convertible Reserved Instance option. Therefore, Option B is the most cost-effective choice if the application being hosted will be used for more than 3 years.
