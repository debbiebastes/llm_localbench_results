An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Rationale:
An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume is a persistent storage volume that can be attached to an EC2 instance. It provides a highly available and durable storage solution for mission-critical workloads.

Amazon S3 is an object store service that provides scalable and durable storage for data. By using Amazon S3 to store the backup data, we can take advantage of its high availability and durability features. Additionally, by configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, we can reduce the cost of storing the backup data.

Option (A) is incorrect because an instance store volume is not a persistent storage solution and may not be suitable for mission-critical workloads. Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA does not provide the same level of durability as Amazon S3 Glacier. Option (D) is incorrect because an instance store volume cannot be used to store backup data.
