A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation: A scheduled scaling policy will allow the application to scale up before the start of the day, when the user traffic is low. This will ensure that the application has enough capacity to handle the increased traffic during the start of the day. The other options do not address the issue of scaling up before the start of the day and may not be effective in handling the sudden spike in traffic. Option A would only adjust the number of instances based on predictive metrics, which may not be accurate during the start of the day when traffic is low. Option B and D would scale based on memory or CPU utilization, which may not be the best metric for this scenario as the application may not be under load yet.
