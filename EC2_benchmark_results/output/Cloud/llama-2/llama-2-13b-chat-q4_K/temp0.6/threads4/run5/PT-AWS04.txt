Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

B) 12

Explanation:
The optimal number of EC2 instances would be 12, as the maximum number of open shards in Kinesis is 6, and each instance can handle one shard. Therefore, 12 instances (6 x 2) are required to process all six open shards optimally.

Note that launching more instances than necessary would not improve performance but increase costs.
