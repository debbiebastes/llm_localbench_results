The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

The most suitable solution in this scenario is option (C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes. 

Explanation:

In this scenario, the immediate need is to mitigate the security risk by deploying patches to the outdated operating systems of the EC2 instances. AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides an easy way to do this. Once the patches are applied, it is essential to record and track any configuration changes for audit purposes.

AWS Config can be used to record and track any configuration changes, including the deployment of patches and any other changes made to the EC2 instances. By integrating AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager with AWS Config, you can ensure that all changes are properly recorded and tracked for compliance purposes.

Option (A) Deploying patches using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager and integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana is not the most suitable solution as it does not address the immediate security risk, and it may take more time and effort to set up.

Option (B) Using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems, and using Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes is not the most suitable solution as it does not provide an easy way to record and track changes for audit purposes.

Option (D) Configuring the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis is not the most suitable solution as it may not address the immediate security risk, and it may not be feasible to implement this solution in all cases.
