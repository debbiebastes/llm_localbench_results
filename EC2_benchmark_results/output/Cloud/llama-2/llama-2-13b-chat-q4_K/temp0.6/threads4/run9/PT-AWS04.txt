Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

The maximum number of EC2 instances required to achieve optimum performance is 12.

Explanation:

Since you have six open shards, each instance can process three shards simultaneously. Therefore, to process all six shards, you need 12 instances (6 shards x 2 instances per shard). Launching more instances than this will not improve performance as the instances will be underutilized.

Note that this assumes that each instance has one KCL worker, and each worker can process only one shard at a time. If you have multiple workers per instance, you may need fewer instances to achieve the same level of performance.
