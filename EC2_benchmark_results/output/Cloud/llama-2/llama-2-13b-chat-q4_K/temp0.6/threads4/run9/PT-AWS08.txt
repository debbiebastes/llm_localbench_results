An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B is the correct answer.

Explanation:

To meet the requirement for a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads, you should choose an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume instead of an instance store volume. EBS volumes provide a more durable and reliable storage option compared to instance stores, which are only available in certain Amazon EC2 instances.

Option B is the correct choice because it proposes to attach an EBS volume to the existing EC2 instance. This will provide a persistent block storage volume that can be used for storing backup data. Additionally, using Amazon S3 to store the backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days will meet the requirement for long-term data storage at a lower cost.

Option A is incorrect because it proposes to attach an instance store volume instead of an EBS volume. Instance stores are not designed for mission-critical workloads and may not provide the required level of durability and reliability.

Option C is incorrect because it proposes to attach an EBS volume in a different availability zone, which may not meet the requirement for a persistent block storage volume that can be used across multiple zones.

Option D is incorrect because it proposes to attach an instance store volume instead of an EBS volume. As mentioned earlier, instance stores are not designed for mission-critical workloads and may not provide the required level of durability and reliability.
