Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 

Correct Answer: B. Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed event bus that allows you to communicate between different services and microservices in your application, enabling loosely coupled architectures.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queue service that enables you to decouple components of your application by using a message queue. However, it does not provide the same level of event-driven functionality as Amazon EventBridge.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a messaging service that enables you to send messages or push notifications to multiple subscribers or clients. While it can be used for event-driven architecture, it is not as flexible and fully featured as Amazon EventBridge.

Amazon Kinesis is a streaming service that enables you to build real-time data pipelines and process large amounts of data in motion. While it can be used for event-driven architecture, it is primarily designed for high-throughput, real-time data processing and not for decoupling components of your application.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).
