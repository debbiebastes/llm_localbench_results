A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Correct explanation:

Option A is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk because it allows for real-time detection of security groups that allow traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and it provides a automated remediation process through Systems Manager Automation document associated with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule. This approach is efficient because it eliminates the need for manual review of security groups and allows for rapid remediation of any security risks detected.

The other options are not as effective:

* Option B, setting up a Transit VPC, would require significant changes to the company's network infrastructure and would not address the specific security risk identified.
* Option C, blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, would not provide real-time detection of security groups that allow traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range and would require manual configuration of Network ACLs.
* Option D, using AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, is not a comprehensive solution as it only provides monitoring and does not provide automated remediation.
