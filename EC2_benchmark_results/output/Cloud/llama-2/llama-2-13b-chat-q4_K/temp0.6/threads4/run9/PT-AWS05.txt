A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

* Option A is not related to compliance requirements, but rather to improve performance by using an optimized version of DynamoDB for certain workloads.
* Option B is not ideal because it requires manual intervention to set up Point-in-Time Recovery and might not be automated.
* Option D is a possible solution, but it requires more setup and maintenance compared to option C. EventBridge provides a more straightforward way to track changes in DynamoDB and trigger actions based on those changes.

EventBridge allows you to create rules that listen for events from multiple AWS services, including DynamoDB table-level events. By setting up a rule that triggers when new items are added or updated in the DynamoDB table, you can automatically process and save the changes to the other table. This approach is more straightforward and requires less setup and maintenance compared to using DynamoDB Streams and a Lambda function. Additionally, EventBridge provides more features such as filtering, pattern matching, and integration with other AWS services like CloudWatch and S3, making it a more versatile solution for compliance requirements.
