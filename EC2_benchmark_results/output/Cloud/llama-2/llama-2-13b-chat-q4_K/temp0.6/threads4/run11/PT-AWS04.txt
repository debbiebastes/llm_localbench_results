Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

B

Explanation:

Since each instance has one KCL worker, and there are six open shards in the resharded stream, the maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched to achieve optimum performance is 6 (i.e., one instance per shard). Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
