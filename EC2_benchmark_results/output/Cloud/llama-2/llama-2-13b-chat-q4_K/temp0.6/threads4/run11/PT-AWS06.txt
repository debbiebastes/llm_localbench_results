A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Correct explanation: When a Lambda function is used as a proxy integration backend, the output of the function must be compatible with the content type specified in the API Gateway. If the output is not compatible, it will result in a 502 Bad Gateway error. In this case, since the developer was able to invoke the underlying function properly and it returned the result in XML format, it suggests that the issue is related to the compatibility of the output from the Lambda function with the API Gateway's content type. Therefore, option (A) is the most likely root cause of the issue.
