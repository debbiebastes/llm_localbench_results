An e-commerce company wants to migrate its on-premise infrastructure to Amazon Web Services. However, they are worried about ensuring their migration is secure and efficient.

Which of the following AWS Cloud Adoption Framework perspective would be the most essential for the company’s migration?

(A) Security Perspective
(B) Governance Perspective
(C) Operations Perspective
(D) Platform Perspective

Answer: 

Correct answer is (D) Platform Perspective.

Explanation:

The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework consists of five perspectives that help organizations migrate to the cloud securely and efficiently. These perspectives are Security, Governance, Operations, Platform, and People.

Of these perspectives, the Platform Perspective is the most essential for the e-commerce company’s migration because it focuses on the technical aspects of the migration, such as selecting the appropriate AWS services, designing the architecture, and configuring the infrastructure.

The Operations Perspective would also be important, as it focuses on the day-to-day management of the infrastructure and applications once they are in the cloud. However, the Platform Perspective is the primary focus during the migration process.
