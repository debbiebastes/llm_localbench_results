A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances.

Rationale:
Predictive scaling is a more operationally efficient solution compared to Dynamic or Scheduled scaling because it can predict future resource needs based on historical usage patterns and adjusts the instance count accordingly. In this case, the application's usage pattern is consistent with a predictive scaling policy that can automatically adjust the number of instances during the start of the day when the demand for resources is high.

The other options are not the best solutions:

B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on Memory utilization. While dynamic scaling can help to handle sudden spikes in resource usage, it may not be the most efficient solution in this case because the application's usage pattern is consistent and predictable.

C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day. This approach may not be the most operationally efficient solution because it requires manual intervention to schedule the scaling event, and it may not take into account the actual usage pattern of the application.

D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on CPU utilization. While dynamic scaling can help to handle sudden spikes in resource usage, it may not be the most efficient solution in this case because the application's usage pattern is consistent and predictable.
