A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation: If the application being hosted will be used for more than 3 years, then the No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term is the most cost-effective option. This pricing option provides the lowest hourly rate for the entire 3-year term, which can lead to significant cost savings compared to On-Demand EC2 instances. Additionally, this pricing option allows for flexibility in case the application usage changes over time, as Convertible Reserved Instances can be exchanged or cancelled with little penalty.
