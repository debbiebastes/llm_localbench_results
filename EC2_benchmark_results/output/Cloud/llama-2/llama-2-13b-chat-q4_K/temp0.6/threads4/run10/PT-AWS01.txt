A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Rationale:
Amazon KMS provides centralized management of encryption keys, which can be used to encrypt data stored in S3 buckets. By using a KMS-managed customer master key, the security engineer can ensure that the sensitive PII data is encrypted on the client side before it is sent over the network to AWS. This approach eliminates the need for the unencrypted data to be sent to AWS, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

Option A is not appropriate because it would require the security engineer to manage the encryption keys on the client side, which could lead to security issues if the keys are not properly managed.

Option C is not appropriate because it would require AWS to manage the encryption keys, which could potentially expose the sensitive PII data to unauthorized access.

Option D is not appropriate because it would require the security engineer to provide the encryption key to AWS, which could compromise the security of the data.
