The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:

The best solution in this scenario is option (C), which involves using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances, and setting up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes. This approach provides a comprehensive solution that addresses both the security risk and audit requirements.

AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager allows for easy deployment of OS patches across multiple EC2 instances, ensuring that all instances are up-to-date with the latest security patches. This reduces the risk of cyber security attacks and vulnerabilities.

Additionally, setting up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes provides an audit trail that demonstrates compliance with security policies and regulatory requirements. AWS Config captures detailed information about the instances, including their configuration history, which can be used to monitor and troubleshoot issues, as well as to prove compliance.

Option (A) is not suitable because it does not address the audit requirement for recording and tracking configuration changes. Option (B) is also not suitable because it uses a separate service (Amazon ES) that may not be necessary in this scenario. Option (D) does not provide a comprehensive solution for deploying OS patches and recording configuration changes.
