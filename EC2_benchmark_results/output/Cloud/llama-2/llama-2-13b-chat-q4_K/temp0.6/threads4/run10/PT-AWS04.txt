Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(B) 12

Explanation:
With six open shards, each EC2 instance can process three shards. This means that you need 12 instances to process all six shards in parallel. With 12 instances, you achieve optimal performance for processing the increased volume of data in your Kinesis stream.

Note that the number of instances needed to achieve optimum performance depends on other factors such as the amount of data being processed, the complexity of the data processing, and the available resources such as memory and CPU. However, in general, increasing the number of instances will lead to better performance as long as the resources are sufficient.
