Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 

Correct Answer: B. Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Explanation:
Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed event bus that allows you to communicate between independent services and applications, enabling loosely coupled architectures.

Option A, Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service), is a messaging service that enables message queuing between AWS services and applications. While it can be used for event-driven architecture, it does not provide the same level of flexibility as EventBridge.

Option C, Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service), is a push notification service that allows you to send notifications to multiple subscribers or clients. It is not designed for decoupling components of an application architecture.

Option D, Amazon Kinesis, is a streaming service that enables real-time data processing and event-driven architectures. While it can be used for building event-driven applications, it does not provide the same level of flexibility as EventBridge in terms of decoupling components of an application architecture.
