An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Option B is the correct answer because it meets all of the requirements mentioned:

* Persistent block storage volume: EBS provides persistent block-level storage that is ideal for mission-critical workloads.
* Backup data stored in Amazon S3: S3 is a highly durable and scalable object storage service that can store large amounts of backup data.
* Lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier: By configuring a lifecycle policy, you can automatically move older backup data to Amazon S3 Glacier for long-term archiving, which meets the requirement of storing backup data for 30 days and then moving it to an archive storage service.

Option A is not correct because instance store volumes are temporary block-level storage that is tied to a specific EC2 instance and cannot be used for long-term storage. Option C is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not designed for long-term archiving and does not meet the requirement of storing backup data for 30 days before moving it to an archive storage service. Option D is incorrect because using an instance store volume for long-term storage is not recommended, as they are intended for temporary use only.
