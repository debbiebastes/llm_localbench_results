Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(B) 12

Explanation:

The maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance is 12. This is because each KCL worker can process one shard, and with six open shards, you need 6 x 1 = 6 KCL workers to process all the shards.

However, it's important to note that adding more instances beyond what is needed for processing all the shards will not improve performance and may only increase costs. Therefore, you should aim to launch only as many instances as are necessary to process all the shards and no more. In this case, 12 instances would be the maximum number needed.
