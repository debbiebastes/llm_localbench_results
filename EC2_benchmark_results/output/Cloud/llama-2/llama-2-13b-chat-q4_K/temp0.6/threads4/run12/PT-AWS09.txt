A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

B. Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:

API Gateway can help protect the backend systems from traffic spikes by enabling throttling limits and result caching. Throttling limits can help regulate the number of requests that are allowed to reach the backend systems, while result caching can help reduce the load on the backend systems by storing frequently requested results in memory.

Option A is not a good choice because EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling are not necessary for protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes. Option C is also not a good choice because CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) and would not help protect the backend systems from traffic spikes. Option D is not relevant to the scenario.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B: Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
