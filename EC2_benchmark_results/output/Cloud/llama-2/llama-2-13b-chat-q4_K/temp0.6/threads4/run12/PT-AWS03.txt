A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
A") Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Correct answer: A)

This is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk because it allows for automated detection and remediation of any security groups that allow traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range without approval. By using AWS Config rules, you can define a rule that checks for security groups with inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range and automatically updates the security group to only allow traffic from the corporate firewall IP address. This approach also leverages Systems Manager Automation and AWS Lambda functions to automate the remediation process, making it more efficient than manual remediation.

Option B is not relevant in this scenario as Transit VPCs are used for connecting multiple VPCs and do not provide direct access to the corporate firewall. Option C would block all traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which may not be desirable if there are legitimate sources that need to communicate with the EC2 instances. Option D is a security feature provided by AWS Shield, but it does not provide automated remediation capabilities. Therefore, option A is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk.
