An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
B

Rationale: EBS (Elastic Block Store) is a block-level storage volume that is attached to an EC2 instance and provides persistent storage. It is suitable for mission-critical workloads and can be used for storing backup data. Amazon S3 is object storage service that stores data in a flat hierarchical structure, and it is not suitable for block-level data. Option B is the correct answer because it suggests attaching an EBS volume to the EC2 instance and using Amazon S3 for storing the backup data, which meets the requirement of persistent block storage for mission-critical workloads.

Option A is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads and should not be used for storing backup data. Option C is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a storage class that supports block-level data. Option D is incorrect because it suggests using an instance store volume instead of EBS volume, which is not suitable for mission-critical workloads.
