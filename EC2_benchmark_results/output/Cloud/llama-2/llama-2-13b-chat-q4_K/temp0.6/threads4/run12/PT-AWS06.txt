A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation: The error code "502 Bad Gateway" is usually caused by an incompatibility between the output of the Lambda function and the API Gateway's expectations. Since the developer mentioned that the underlying function properly returned the result in XML format, it suggests that there is a mismatch in the output format or structure, leading to the 502 error. Therefore, option (A) is the most likely root cause of the issue.
