A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation: 

To comply with strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company, it is important that the unencrypted data and master keys are never sent to AWS. Therefore, option (B) which involves using a KMS-managed customer master key is the most appropriate solution. This approach ensures that the encryption process takes place on the client side and the unencrypted data and master keys remain within the organization. The use of KMS-managed customer master key also provides an additional layer of security as it is managed by AWS Key Management Service (KMS) which meets compliance standards.

Option (A) involves client-side encryption with a client-side master key, which may not provide adequate security and control over the encryption process. Option (C) involves server-side encryption with a KMS-managed key, but this may not meet the requirement of never sending unencrypted data or master keys to AWS. Option (D) allows customer provided key for server-side encryption, which may not be secure as it is not managed by AWS KMS and may not meet compliance standards.
