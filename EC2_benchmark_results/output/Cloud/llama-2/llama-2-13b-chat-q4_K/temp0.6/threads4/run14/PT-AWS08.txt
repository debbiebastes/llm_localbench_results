An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a block-level storage service that provides persistent storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances. EBS volumes are ideal for mission-critical workloads, as they provide persistent storage and can be attached to multiple instances, ensuring that data is always available even if the instance fails or is terminated.

Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides scalable and durable storage for data. It offers various storage classes, including standard, infrequent access (IA), and glacier, each with different performance and cost characteristics.

To meet the requirement of storing backup data in an object storage service and transitioning objects to a data archiving storage service after 30 days, you can attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance and use Amazon S3 to store your backup data. You can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which will provide long-term storage at a lower cost.

Option A is incorrect because instance store volumes are temporary storage volumes that are not persistent and do not meet the requirement of persistent storage for mission-critical workloads. Option C is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a data archiving storage service, and it does not offer the same level of durability as Amazon S3 Glacier. Option D is incorrect because instance store volumes are temporary storage volumes that are not persistent and do not meet the requirement of persistent storage for mission-critical workloads.
