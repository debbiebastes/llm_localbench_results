(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:
The cost-effective option would be to go with the No Upfront, Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option offers the lowest total cost of ownership over the 3-year period, as there is no upfront payment required and the instance can be converted to a different type or size if needed.

Here's a breakdown of the costs:

* All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term (Option A):
	+ Upfront cost: $3,000 (1 year x $250 per month)
	+ Monthly fees: $250 per month (for the next 12 months)
	Total cost: $3,750 (upfront cost + 12 months of monthly fees)
* No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term (Option B):
	+ Monthly fees: $250 per month (for the next 36 months)
	Total cost: $9,000 (3 years x $250 per month)
* All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term (Option C):
	+ Upfront cost: $3,000 (3 years x $1,000 per year)
	Total cost: $3,000 (upfront cost + 3 years of monthly fees)
* No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year (Option D):
	+ Monthly fees: $250 per month (for the next 12 months)
	Total cost: $3,000 (upfront cost + 12 months of monthly fees)

As you can see, Option B offers the lowest total cost of ownership over the 3-year period, as there is no upfront payment required and the instance can be converted to a different type or size if needed.
