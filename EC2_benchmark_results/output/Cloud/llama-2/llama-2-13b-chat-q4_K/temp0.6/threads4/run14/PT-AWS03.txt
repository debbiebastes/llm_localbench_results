A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
A) Using AWS Config rules and Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk. This approach allows for real-time detection and automatic remediation of security risks, and it also integrates well with existing AWS services like Systems Manager and Lambda.

Rationale:

* (B) Setting up a Transit VPC would require additional infrastructure and configuration, which is not the most efficient approach.
* (C) Blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACLs would only provide a temporary solution and would not address the root cause of the issue.
* (D) Using AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range would require additional configuration and setup, and it might not be able to automatically remediate the issue in real-time.
