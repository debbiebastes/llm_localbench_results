Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

B

Explanation:

To determine the maximum number of EC2 instances, we need to calculate the total capacity of the stream after resharding.

Since each shard can process 1/4 of the total data, and there will be six shards in total (including the existing four), the total capacity of the stream will increase by a factor of 6/4 = 1.5 times.

Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance is:

1.5 x 3 = 4.5

Rounding off to the nearest whole number, the answer is B - 12 EC2 instances.
