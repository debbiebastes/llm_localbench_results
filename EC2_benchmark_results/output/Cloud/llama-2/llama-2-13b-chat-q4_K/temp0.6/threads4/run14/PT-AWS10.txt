Answer: 

The correct answer is (C) Operations Perspective.

The Operations Perspective of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework focuses on planning, executing, and operating workloads in the cloud.

Since the company wants to ensure their migration is efficient and secure, they would need to focus on the Operations Perspective to ensure a successful migration.
