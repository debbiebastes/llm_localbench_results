A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

The most ideal way to comply with the requirements is to use Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) to track table-level events in DynamoDB. By creating a rule that triggers when new items are added or updated in the main DynamoDB table, you can set a Lambda function as a target to process and save the new changes to the other table.

Option A, DynamoDB Accelerator, is not relevant for this use case, as it only accelerates data read from DynamoDB, and does not support writing data to another DynamoDB table.

Option B, Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables, may not be the most efficient solution, as it requires setting up a point-in-time recovery, which can lead to higher costs and complexities.

Option D, Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table, is also a valid option, but it may require more resources and infrastructure setup compared to using Amazon EventBridge.
