A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:

The correct answer is (B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This option ensures that the sensitive PII data remains encrypted on the client side, even when it's stored in AWS, and the master keys are never sent to AWS.

Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) manages the customer master key, which is used to encrypt the sensitive data. The client-side encryption ensures that only authorized users can access the encrypted data, even if the data is intercepted or stolen. This option fulfills the requirement of never sending the master keys to AWS, as the KMS manages the customer master key outside of AWS.

Option (A) uses a client-side master key, which may not be secure enough, as the master key is stored on the client side and could be compromised if the client is hacked or lost.

Option (C) uses a server-side encryption with a KMS-managed key, but this would require sending the master keys to AWS, which violates the requirement of never sending the master keys to AWS.

Option (D) uses a customer-provided key, which may not be secure enough, as the customer may not have the necessary expertise or resources to properly manage and secure the encryption key.
