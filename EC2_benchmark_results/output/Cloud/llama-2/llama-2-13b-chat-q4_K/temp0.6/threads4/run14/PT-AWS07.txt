A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

Solution: (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation:

The issue of slow performance at the beginning of the day is due to the sudden increase in traffic as users log in after a long period of inactivity. To address this, we can use a Scheduled scaling policy to launch additional instances before the start of the day, when traffic is low. This will ensure that the application has sufficient resources to handle the increased traffic at the beginning of the day.

Option (A) Predictive scaling policy is not suitable as it uses historical data to predict future usage patterns and may not be effective in this scenario where traffic increases suddenly.

Option (B) Dynamic scaling based on Memory utilization may not be effective as memory usage may not be a good indicator of application performance during the start of the day when traffic is increasing rapidly.

Option (D) Dynamic scaling based on CPU utilization may also not be effective as CPU usage may not be a good indicator of application performance during the start of the day when traffic is increasing rapidly.

Therefore, option (C) Scheduled scaling policy is the most operationally efficient solution to ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day.
