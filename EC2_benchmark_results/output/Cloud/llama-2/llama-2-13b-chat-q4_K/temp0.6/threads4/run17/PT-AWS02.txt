The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:
Option (C) is the most suitable solution in this scenario as it provides a comprehensive approach to mitigate the security risk and maintain compliance.

AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager can be used to deploy OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances, which will help to address the security vulnerability. Additionally, setting up AWS Config will allow the team to record and track any configuration changes made during the patching process, providing a detailed audit trail for compliance purposes.

Option (A) is not suitable as it does not provide a comprehensive solution for patch management and compliance tracking. Option (B) is not necessary as AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager can already deploy patches to EC2 instances. Option (D) is not relevant to the scenario as the goal is to address a security risk, not to automate patch installation on a weekly basis.
