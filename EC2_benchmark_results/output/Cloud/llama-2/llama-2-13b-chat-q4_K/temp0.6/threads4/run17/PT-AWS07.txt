A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances.

Explanation: A predictive scaling policy would allow the auto-scaling group to anticipate and adjust the number of instances based on historical usage patterns, which would help to ensure that the application is able to handle the increased load at the start of the day. This approach would be the most operationally efficient as it would not require manual intervention or complex rules for dynamic scaling.

Option B is not a good choice as it would only consider memory utilization and not the actual usage patterns. Option C would not be effective as scheduling new instances before the start of the day would not address the issue of increased load during that time. Option D would also not be effective as CPU utilization may not accurately reflect the actual usage patterns.
