A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Correct! Using AWS Config rules to automatically detect any security groups that allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and then associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function to remediate the issue is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk.

Here's why:

Option (B) setting up a Transit VPC would not address the specific issue of allowing traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and would instead require additional configuration and setup.

Option (C) blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACLs may not be feasible as it could potentially block legitimate traffic, and would also require ongoing maintenance to ensure that all necessary traffic is allowed.

Option (D) using AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range may not be efficient as it would require additional setup and configuration, and may not provide the same level of granularity as using AWS Config rules.
