A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:

The No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing option offers the lowest cost, since there is no upfront payment required. The price for this option is based on the total usage over the 3-year term, which would be more cost-effective if the application is expected to be used for more than 3 years.

Option A (All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term) has a higher upfront payment and lower hourly usage rates compared to Option B. Option C (All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term) has an even higher upfront payment and is not the most cost-effective option if the application will be used for more than 3 years. Option D (No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year) has a lower upfront payment, but the hourly usage rates are higher compared to Option B, and it would not provide the same level of cost savings over a longer period.
