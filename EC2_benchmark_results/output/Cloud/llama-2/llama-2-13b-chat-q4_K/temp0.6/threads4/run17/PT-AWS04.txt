Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(B) 12

Explanation:

As per the information provided, your application is processing one Kinesis data stream with four shards and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you have resharded the stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

To achieve optimum performance, it's recommended to launch an equal number of EC2 instances as the number of open shards. In this case, you need to launch six EC2 instances to process all six shards in parallel.

Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch is 12 (6 shards x 2 instances per shard).

So, the correct answer is (B) 12.
