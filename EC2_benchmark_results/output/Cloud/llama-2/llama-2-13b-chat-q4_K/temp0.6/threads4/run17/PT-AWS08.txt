An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for persistent block storage and cannot be used for mission-critical workloads.

Option (C) is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a long-term archival storage service, and objects stored in this service will not be kept for 30 days before being transitioned to the archival storage service.

Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for persistent block storage and cannot be used for mission-critical workloads.

Attaching an EBS volume to your EC2 instance provides persistent block storage that can be used for mission-critical workloads. Using Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days meets the requirement of storing backup data in an object storage service and archiving it after 30 days.
