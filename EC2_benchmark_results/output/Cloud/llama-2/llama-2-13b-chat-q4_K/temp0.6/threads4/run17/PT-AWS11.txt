Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Amazon EventBridge is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed event bus that allows you to communicate between different services and applications in your architecture, enabling loosely coupled microservices and serverless architectures.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queue service that enables you to decouple components of your application, but it does not provide event-driven architecture like EventBridge. Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a messaging service that sends messages or push notifications to multiple subscribers or clients, but it also does not provide event-driven architecture like EventBridge. Amazon Kinesis is a streaming service that enables you to build real-time data streaming applications, but it does not provide event-driven architecture like EventBridge.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).
