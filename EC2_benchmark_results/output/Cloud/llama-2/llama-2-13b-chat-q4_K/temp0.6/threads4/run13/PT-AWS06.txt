A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Correct! When integrating with Lambda using the Proxy Integration feature, the output of the Lambda function must match the payload format expected by the API Gateway. If the output is not compatible, it will result in a 502 Bad Gateway error. So, option (A) is the correct answer.

Here's how you can troubleshoot this issue:

1. Check the Lambda function code to ensure that it produces the expected payload format.
2. Verify that the Proxy Integration is correctly configured in the API Gateway.
3. Test the API Gateway using Postman or another tool to validate the output of the Lambda function and check for any errors.
