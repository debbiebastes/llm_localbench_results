An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

To meet the requirement for persistent block storage, you should attach an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume to your existing EC2 instance. EBS volumes provide persistent storage that is not affected by the instance's lifecycle, and they are ideal for mission-critical workloads.

To store your backup data, you can use Amazon S3, which provides object storage with a highly available and durable architecture. You can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which will help reduce storage costs by storing less frequently accessed data in a more cost-effective storage class.

Option A is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads and are not persistent across instance lifecycles. Option C is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a storage class that provides long-term archival storage, and it may not be the best fit for your backup data. Option D is also incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads and are not persistent across instance lifecycles.
