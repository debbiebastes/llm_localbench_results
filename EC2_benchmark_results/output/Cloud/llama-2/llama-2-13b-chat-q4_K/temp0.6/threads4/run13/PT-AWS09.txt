A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

The best answer is (C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.

Explanation: CloudFront can act as a reverse proxy and cache for the API Gateway, helping to distribute traffic more evenly across the platform's backend systems. By caching frequently requested data and serving it from edge locations closer to end-users, CloudFront can help reduce the load on the backend systems and protect them from traffic spikes. Additionally, CloudFront offers other features such as request collapsing and header manipulation that can further help optimize the performance of the platform.
