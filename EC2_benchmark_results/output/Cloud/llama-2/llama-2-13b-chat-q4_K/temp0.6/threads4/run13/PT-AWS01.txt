A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Rationale:

The hospital needs to ensure that its sensitive PII data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and the solution should not rely on AWS for storing or managing the encryption keys. By using a KMS-managed customer master key, the hospital can maintain control over the encryption process without having to store the master keys in AWS. This approach also ensures that the encryption keys are securely generated, distributed, and revoked, as well as compliant with relevant regulations.

Option (A) is not a good choice because it would require storing the client-side master key in the client application, which could be vulnerable to exposure or theft. Option (C) is also not a good choice because it would require AWS to store and manage the encryption keys, which could compromise compliance and security. Option (D) is not a valid option because customer-provided keys are not secure for sensitive data storage.
