Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 

Correct Answer: (B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Explanation:

Amazon EventBridge (previously known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed service for handling events, allowing you to focus on building your application without worrying about managing infrastructure.

Amazon EventBridge provides a variety of features, including:

* Event sources: You can create event sources in Amazon EventBridge, such as AWS services like EC2 or DynamoDB, or custom event sources that you create yourself.
* Event handlers: You can specify one or more event handlers for each event source, which are the actions that should be taken when an event is received.
* Event filtering: You can filter events based on specific criteria, such as the type of event or the source of the event.
* Event batching: Amazon EventBridge can group multiple events into a single batch, reducing the number of API calls required to process events.

Therefore, Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) is the correct answer.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a messaging service that enables you to send and receive messages in a decoupled architecture. However, it does not provide event-driven functionality like Amazon EventBridge.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a messaging service that sends notifications or messages to multiple subscribers or clients. It does not provide event-driven functionality like Amazon EventBridge either.

Amazon Kinesis is a streaming service that enables you to collect, process, and analyze real-time data streams. While it can be used for event-driven applications, it is not the primary service for building such applications like Amazon EventBridge.
