A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

The MOST operationally efficient solution would be option (C) Configuring a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day. This approach allows you to proactively scale your resources in advance of the expected increase in demand, rather than reactively adjusting your resources after performance issues have already occurred.

Option (A) Configuring a Predictive scaling policy would require advanced machine learning algorithms and historical data to predict the usage patterns accurately, which may not be feasible for every organization.

Option (B) Configuring a Dynamic scaling policy based on Memory utilization may not be the most effective approach, as memory usage may not be the limiting factor during the start of the day when users are accessing the application simultaneously.

Option (D) Configuring a Dynamic scaling policy based on CPU utilization may also not be the most effective approach, as CPU usage may not be the limiting factor during the start of the day when users are accessing the application simultaneously.
