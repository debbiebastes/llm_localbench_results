A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B. No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term

Explanation:
The most cost-effective option would be to opt for the No Upfront, Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term (Option B). This option offers the lowest total cost of ownership over a 3-year period. Here's why:

1. Lower upfront costs: With Option B, there are no upfront costs associated with purchasing a Reserved Instance.
2. Flexibility: Convertible Reserved Instances offer more flexibility in terms of instance types and regions, allowing the company to adjust their configuration as needed over the 3-year period.
3. Lower renewal prices: The renewal prices for Convertible Reserved Instances are lower compared to Standard Reserved Instances (Option C).
4. Long-term savings: By opting for a longer term (3 years), the company can save more on costs over time, even with the lower upfront costs of Option B.

In summary, while All Upfront options (Option A) might seem like the best deal initially, they lock you into a specific instance type and region for a year, which may not be ideal if your needs change over time. On the other hand, No Upfront options like Option B offer more flexibility and long-term cost savings, making them the most cost-effective option for a 3-year commitment.
