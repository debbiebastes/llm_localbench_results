Answer: 

B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed event bus that allows you to communicate between independent microservices or applications, enabling loosely coupled architectures. With EventBridge, you can easily integrate with other AWS services such as Lambda, SNS, SQS, and more, making it a powerful tool for building scalable and resilient applications.
