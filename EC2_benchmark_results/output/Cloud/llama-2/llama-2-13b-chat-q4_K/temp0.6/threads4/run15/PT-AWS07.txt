A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

The MOST operationally efficient solution to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day is to configure a Scheduled scaling policy (Option C). This option allows you to specify when the scaling should occur, in this case, before the start of the day.

Configuring a Predictive scaling policy (Option A) would require machine learning algorithms to predict future usage, which might not be necessary in this scenario.

Configuring a Dynamic scaling policy based on Memory utilization (Option B) might not be effective as the application's performance issues might not be solely due to memory usage.

Configuring a Dynamic scaling policy based on CPU utilization (Option D) would only scale based on CPU usage, which might not address the issue of slow performance at the start of the day.
