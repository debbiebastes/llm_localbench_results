A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Rationale: The cost of the Reserved Instance will be lower with the No Upfront option since there is no upfront payment required. Since the application will be used for more than 3 years, it would be more cost-effective to pay the hourly usage fees for the entire 3-year term rather than making an upfront payment and potentially overpaying for unused capacity. The Convertible option allows for the possibility of changing the instance type or operating system without penalty, which may be beneficial if the application's requirements change over time.
