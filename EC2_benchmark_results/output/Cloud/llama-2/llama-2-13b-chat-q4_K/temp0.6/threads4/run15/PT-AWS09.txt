A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:

When there is an unexpected surge in traffic, it can be challenging to handle the sudden spike in requests without proper scaling and load balancing. In this scenario, enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway can help protect the backend systems from traffic spikes.

Throttling limits can control the number of requests that a client can make within a specific time frame, preventing overloading the system with too many requests. Result caching can store the results of previous requests, reducing the load on the backend systems and providing faster responses to subsequent requests.

Option A is not the best choice because EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling are not necessarily more scalable or highly available than AWS Lambda and API Gateway.

Option C would also not be effective in this scenario as CloudFront is a content delivery network and would not provide the necessary throttling and caching capabilities.

Option D would not directly address the issue of traffic spikes, but it could help improve the security and performance of the system by moving the Lambda function to a VPC.
