An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
B

Rationale: 
Option B is the best choice because an EBS volume provides persistent block storage, which is well-suited for mission-critical workloads. Option A is not suitable since instance store volumes are temporary and may be lost if the underlying instance is terminated or replaced. Option C and D are not valid options as Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a storage service that supports block storage.

Moreover, attaching an EBS volume in your existing EC2 instance will provide you with a persistent block storage volume that can be used for your mission-critical workloads. You can use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which will help you to reduce your costs by storing less frequently accessed data in a more cost-effective storage service.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
