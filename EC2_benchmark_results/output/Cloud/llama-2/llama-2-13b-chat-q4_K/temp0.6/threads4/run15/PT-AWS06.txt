A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Correct answer: A. When you use AWS Lambda as a backend for an API Gateway, it is important to ensure that the output of the Lambda function is compatible with the content type specified in the API Gateway. If the output is not compatible, API Gateway will return a 502 Bad Gateway error. In this case, the developer stated that the underlying function properly returned the result in XML format, so the issue likely lies with the compatibility of the output from the Lambda function.
