A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:

To ensure that the sensitive PII data is encrypted at rest and in transit, and to comply with the strict regulatory requirements, the Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption using a KMS-managed customer master key (B). This approach ensures that the sensitive data remains encrypted even when it is stored in S3 buckets. Additionally, this technique eliminates the need for storing the master keys on AWS, as the keys are managed by the customer's KMS.

Option A is not correct because client-side encryption with a client-side master key does not provide the same level of security as KMS-managed encryption. Option C is also not correct because server-side encryption does not provide the necessary control over the encryption process, and Option D is not correct because customer provided keys may not be secure or compliant with regulatory requirements.
