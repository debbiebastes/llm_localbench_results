A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.

Rationale:
The issue is most likely due to insufficient resources, particularly memory. Launching new instances based on memory utilization will ensure that there are enough resources available during peak usage periods. Predictive scaling would not be effective in this case as it is based on historical data and may not accurately predict future usage patterns. Scheduled scaling would also not be effective as the issue is specific to the start of the day. Dynamic scaling based on CPU utilization may not be effective either, as CPU utilization may not be the limiting factor during the initial rush of users in the morning.
