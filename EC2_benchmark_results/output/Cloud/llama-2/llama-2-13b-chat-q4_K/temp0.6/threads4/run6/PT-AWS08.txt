An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Rationale:

Option B is the correct answer because it provides a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, which is required in the question statement. Additionally, using an EBS volume ensures that the data is not lost if the instance is terminated or rebooted.

Option A does not provide a persistent block storage volume and may not be suitable for mission-critical workloads. Option C does not provide a persistent block storage volume and would not be able to store the backup data for 30 days as required. Option D does not provide a persistent block storage volume and would not be able to store the backup data in an object storage service.

Therefore, option B is the best answer that meets all the requirements mentioned in the question statement.
