Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

To achieve optimum performance, you need to ensure that each instance has at least one KCL worker per shard. With six open shards, you need at least six KCL workers running concurrently. Since each EC2 instance can run only one KCL worker, you should launch six instances. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 6.
