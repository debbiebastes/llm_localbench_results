A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:
If the company plans to use the application for more than 3 years, the most cost-effective option would be the No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option allows you to pay hourly for the usage of the instance and provides the flexibility to convert your reservation into a different instance type or operating system as needed.

Option A, All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term, would require a higher upfront payment and may not provide the same level of cost savings as option B over a longer period.

Option C, All Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term, would also require a higher upfront payment and may not offer the same flexibility as option B.

Option D, No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year, would result in higher costs over time due to the continuous renewal fees.
