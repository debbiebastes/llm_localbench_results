A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Rationale: A 502 Bad Gateway error typically indicates that the server acting as a gateway is receiving an incorrect response from an upstream server. In this case, the developer received the error when invoking the Amazon API Gateway proxy integration, which suggests that the issue is with the output returned by the Lambda function. The fact that the function properly returned the result in XML format suggests that the problem lies with the output format being incompatible with the API Gateway's expectations.
