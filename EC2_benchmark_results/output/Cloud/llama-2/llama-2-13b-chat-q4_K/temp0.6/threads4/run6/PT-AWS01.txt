A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:

The best approach to ensure compliance and protect sensitive PII data is to use client-side encryption. In this scenario, the Security Engineer should implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach ensures that the sensitive data is encrypted on the client-side before it is sent over the network to AWS, and only the authorized client-side application has access to the encryption keys.

Option (A) is not suitable because it uses a client-side master key, which can be compromised if the client-side application is breached. Option (C) is also not suitable because it uses a server-side managed key, which may not meet the compliance requirements of the company. Option (D) is not a valid option as customer-provided keys are not supported for S3 encryption.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.
