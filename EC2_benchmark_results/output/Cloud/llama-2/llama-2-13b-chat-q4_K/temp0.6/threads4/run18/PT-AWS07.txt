A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the issue is related to the performance of the application during the start of the day, which means that there is a high demand for resources at the beginning of the day. By configuring a Scheduled scaling policy, you can launch additional instances before the start of the day, to handle the increased traffic and demand. This will ensure that the application performs well at the beginning of the day.

Option (A) Predictive scaling is not the best choice here as it would adjust the number of instances based on historical usage patterns, which may not accurately predict the demand at the start of the day.

Option (B) Dynamic scaling based on Memory utilization may not be effective as memory usage may not be the best indicator of demand during the start of the day.

Option (D) Dynamic scaling based on CPU utilization would adjust the number of instances based on CPU usage, but this may not address the issue of high demand at the start of the day.
