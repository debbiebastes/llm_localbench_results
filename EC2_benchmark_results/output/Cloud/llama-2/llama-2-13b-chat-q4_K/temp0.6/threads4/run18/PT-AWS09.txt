A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Rationale:
Option (A) would require significant changes to the existing architecture, which may not be feasible given the short notice of the expected traffic surge. Option (C) would add an additional layer of complexity and may not provide sufficient performance improvements. Option (D) would only partially address the issue by moving the Lambda function to a VPC, without providing any additional scaling or caching capabilities.

Option (B), on the other hand, provides a simple and effective solution to protect the backend systems from traffic spikes. By enabling throttling limits in API Gateway, we can control the number of requests that are sent to the Lambda function, preventing it from becoming overwhelmed. Additionally, result caching in API Gateway can help reduce the load on the Lambda function by storing frequently accessed data locally, reducing the need for subsequent API calls. This approach is easy to implement and requires no significant changes to the existing architecture, making it the best choice for protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes.
