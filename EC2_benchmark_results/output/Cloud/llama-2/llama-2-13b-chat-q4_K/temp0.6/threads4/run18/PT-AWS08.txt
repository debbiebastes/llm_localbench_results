An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

Correct answer is option B: Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Option A is incorrect because instance store volumes are not designed for persistent storage and are not suitable for mission-critical workloads.

Option C is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a cost-optimized storage class that is not suitable for long-term archiving of data.

Option D is incorrect because instance store volumes are not designed for persistent storage and are not suitable for mission-critical workloads.

Attaching an EBS volume in your EC2 instance will provide persistent block-level storage that is suitable for mission-critical workloads. Using Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier will provide long-term archiving of your backup data at a cost-effective price.
