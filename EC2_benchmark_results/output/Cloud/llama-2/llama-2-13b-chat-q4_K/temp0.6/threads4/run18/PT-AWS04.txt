Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12

Explanation:

Since each instance has one KCL worker and there are six open shards, you can launch up to 6 instances (one for each shard). However, as a safety net, you should consider adding some extra instances to handle any failures or spikes in processing. In this case, the maximum number of instances that would achieve optimum performance is 12.

So, the answer is (B) 12.
