A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:

If the application will be used for more than 3 years, it's more cost-effective to go with the No Upfront option, which offers the lowest hourly price for the entire 3-year term. This pricing model allows you to pay only for the actual usage of the instances and not upfront.

Option A, All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term, would require an upfront payment for the entire year and might not be cost-effective if the application is used for more than 3 years.

Option C, All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term, also requires an upfront payment for the entire 3-year term, which might not be feasible for long-term commitments.

Option D, No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year, would require a yearly commitment and might not offer the same cost savings as the No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance option for a longer-term commitment.
