A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation: 

To comply with the strict regulations and compliance requirements of the hospital, the Security Engineer should use an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. With this approach, the sensitive PII data will be encrypted on the client-side using a KMS-managed key, which will ensure that neither the master key nor the unencrypted data is sent to AWS. The KMS-managed key will provide an additional layer of security and control over the encryption process, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access the encrypted data stored in the Amazon S3 bucket.

The other options are not suitable for this use case:

A) Implementing client-side encryption with a client-side master key would require the hospital to manage and securely store the master key, which may not be feasible or desirable.

C) Implementing server-side encryption with a KMS managed key would require AWS to have access to the unencrypted data, which is not acceptable in this scenario.

D) Implementing server-side encryption with customer provided key would not provide adequate security controls and may be vulnerable to unauthorized access.
