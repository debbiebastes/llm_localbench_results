A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
(A) Using AWS Config rules is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk. This approach allows you to define a set of rules to monitor and update security groups, and associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function to remediate any violations. By using AWS Config rules, you can automate the process of updating security groups to ensure that only traffic from trusted IP addresses is allowed.

Explanation:

Option (B) setting up a Transit VPC would not automatically remediate the security risk, as it would still allow traffic from any source IP address to reach the EC2 instances.

Option (C) blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACLs would also not be an efficient solution, as it would block all traffic from any source IP address, which may not be desirable.

Option (D) using AWS Shield to monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is a good approach, but it does not provide an automatic remediation solution. AWS Shield can help identify potential security risks, but it cannot automatically update security groups to block unauthorized traffic.
