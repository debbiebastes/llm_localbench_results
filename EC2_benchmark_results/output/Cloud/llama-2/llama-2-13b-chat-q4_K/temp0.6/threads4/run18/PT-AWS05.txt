A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:
Option C is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements because it allows for real-time processing of new changes made to items in DynamoDB, without the need for manual intervention or additional infrastructure setup like Accelerator or Point-in-Time Recovery.

With EventBridge, you can create a rule that triggers whenever there are changes to the items in DynamoDB, and then route those changes to a Lambda function for processing. The Lambda function can then save the new changes to the other table in another region. This approach is highly scalable, secure, and easy to set up, making it the most ideal solution for this use case.
