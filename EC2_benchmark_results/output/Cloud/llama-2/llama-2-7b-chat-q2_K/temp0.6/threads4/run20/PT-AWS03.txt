A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Explanation:
The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is to use AWS Config rules to detect whether there are any security groups allowing inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. By using AWS Config, you can automate the process of updating the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This way, you can ensure that all security groups are updated consistently and efficiently without manual intervention.
Option (B) is not the most efficient way to remediate this risk because it involves setting up a Transit VPC, which can be time-consuming and may require additional resources. Option (C) is also not the best solution because it involves blocking traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACLs. This approach may not be effective in detecting all security risks, especially if there are many instances or services that need to be monitored and updated.
Option (D) is not a viable solution because AWS Shield is not designed to detect security group rules and cannot automatically remediate this type of security risk.
