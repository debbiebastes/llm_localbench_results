The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The most suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Reason:
Option (A) provides a comprehensive solution that addresses both the immediate need to mitigate security risks and the audit requirements for compliance. By deploying OS patches using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, the team can quickly address the vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. Additionally, integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana enables the team to record and track any configuration changes, providing a complete audit trail for compliance purposes.
Option (B) focuses on AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy patches for the outdated EC2 instances. While this approach may provide some benefits, it does not offer the same level of comprehensive security as option (A). Option (C) also focuses on AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager but does not address any additional compliance requirements. Finally, option (D) only addresses the automatic installation of OS patches on a weekly basis, which may not be sufficient to mitigate immediate security risks or meet audit requirements for compliance.
