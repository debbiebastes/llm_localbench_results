An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.

Explanation:
You should use an EBS volume for storing mission-critical data that needs to be persistently stored, such as a block storage volume. An EBS volume provides better performance and reliability than an instance store volume, which is internal to the instance. By using an EBS volume, you can ensure that your data is persisted even if your instance fails or is terminated.
To meet the requirement of storing backup data in Amazon S3 after 30 days, you can configure a lifecycle policy in Amazon S3 to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. Amazon S3 Glacier provides a low-cost, long-term archival storage solution for infrequently accessed data.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are internal to the instance and do not provide the same level of persistency as EBS volumes. Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a new storage service that was launched in 2022, and it does not support lifecycle policies for transitioning objects between storage classes.
Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are internal to the instance and do not provide the same level of persistency as EBS volumes.
