Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The answer is (D) 6.

To achieve optimum performance in your application, you should launch a maximum of six EC2 instances for processing. By resharding your stream to increase the number of open shards from four to six, you have effectively doubled the capacity of your instance to handle more data processing. However, it is important to note that increasing the number of instances beyond six may not necessarily result in better performance, as there may be diminishing returns on the benefits of scaling beyond this point.
Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch for optimum performance is six, and no more than that.
