Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
D - Six

Rationale: When you reshard your stream, you increase the number of open shards from four to six. This means that each instance has two additional shards to process, which can increase the overall processing capacity of the application. However, launching too many instances can lead to increased costs and complexity without resulting in significant performance gains. Therefore, the optimal number of EC2 instances to achieve optimum performance is six.
