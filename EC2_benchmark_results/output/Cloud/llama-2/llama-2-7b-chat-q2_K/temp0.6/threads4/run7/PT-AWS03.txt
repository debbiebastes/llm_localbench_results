A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
AWS Config is an AWS service that allows you to manage configurations of AWS resources, including security groups. By using AWS Config, you can automatically detect whether there are any security groups that allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and then remediate them by updating the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This will ensure that only authorized traffic is allowed to flow into the instances, and unauthorized traffic is blocked.
Option (B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because it requires manual configuration of the Transit VPC and the associated subnets. This approach may also require additional configuration and setup, which can increase the time and cost associated with remediation.
Option (C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because it may not detect all instances of unauthorized traffic. Unauthorized traffic may come from other sources, such as malicious actors or accidental misconfigurations, which can bypass the Network ACL.
Option (D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because AWS Shield is primarily designed for monitoring and filtering outbound traffic, rather than inbound traffic. It may also require additional setup and configuration to monitor and detect security groups that allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.
