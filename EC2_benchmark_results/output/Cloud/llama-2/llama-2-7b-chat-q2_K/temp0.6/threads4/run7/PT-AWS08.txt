An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.

Explanation:
An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume provides persistent block storage that is suitable for mission-critical workloads. Unlike instance store volumes, which are stored on the root partition of the instance and are only available during the lifetime of the instance, EBS volumes are stored independently and can be attached to any EC2 instance.
To meet the requirement of using an organization's backup data in Amazon S3, you should attach an EBS volume to your EC2 instance. This will allow you to store your backup data in Amazon S3 without worrying about the lifecycle of your EC2 instance. You can then configure a lifecycle policy in Amazon S3 to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier or Amazon S3 One Zone-IA, depending on your organization's storage requirements.
Option (A) is incorrect because attaching an instance store volume does not provide persistent storage, and Option (C) is incorrect because Amazon S3 does not support storing data in Amazon S3 One Zone-IA. Only Amazon S3 Glacier supports long-term archiving of data.
