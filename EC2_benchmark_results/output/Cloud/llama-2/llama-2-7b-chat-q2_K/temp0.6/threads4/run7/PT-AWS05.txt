A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements would be option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, and set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach provides the following benefits:

1. Centralized management of changes: The EventBridge rule can be configured to track changes made to the original table and forward them to the secondary table in another region. This ensures that all changes are properly recorded and stored in the secondary table.
2. Automated processing: By setting a Lambda function as a rule target, new changes can be automatically processed and saved to the secondary table without any manual intervention.
3. Reduced risk of data loss: In the event of an outage or other disruption to the primary table, the secondary table will have a complete record of all changes made to the original table. This reduces the risk of data loss or corruption.
4. Improved compliance: By implementing a centralized and automated process for recording and storing new changes, the company can improve its IT compliance by ensuring that all changes are properly documented and stored in a separate table.
