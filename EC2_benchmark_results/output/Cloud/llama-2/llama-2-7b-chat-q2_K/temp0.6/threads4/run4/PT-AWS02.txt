The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
This approach provides a centralized and automated way to manage the security patches for the EC2 instances, ensuring that all instances are up-to-date and secure. By integrating AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager with Amazon QuickSight and Kibana, the IT team can easily track and record any changes made to patch configurations, providing auditable records of compliance and security posture for future reference.
Option (B) would require more manual effort to set up and manage Patch Manager, which may not be feasible in a time-sensitive situation like this. Option (C) is similar to (B), but it does not provide the same level of automation as AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Option (D) is not a practical solution as it would require manual intervention on a weekly basis, which may not be feasible or sustainable in the long term.
