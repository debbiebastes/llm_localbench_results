A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The most operationally efficient solution to implement is (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day. This approach will allow you to launch new instances in advance, giving them time to spin up and reach peak performance before the workload increases at the beginning of the day.
Option (A), Configure a Predictive scaling policy, can also help with the issue but it may not be as effective as (C) as it relies on historical data to predict future usage patterns, which may not always be accurate. Option (B), Configure a Dynamic scaling policy, is less efficient as it will only launch new instances based on memory utilization, which may not address the issue of slow performance at the start of the day. Option (D), Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on CPU utilization, can also be less effective as it may lead to overprovisioning of instances and increase costs.
