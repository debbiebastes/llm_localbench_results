A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:
Amazon S3 provides two types of encryption for storing data in S3 buckets, i.e., server-side encryption (SSE) and client-side encryption (SCE). SSE is performed by AWS on the bucket's behalf, while SCE is done by the user on their local machine before uploading the data to S3.
In this case, the web application must comply with strict regulatory requirements, so it's important to use client-side encryption (SCE) to ensure that sensitive PII data remains encrypted both in transit and at rest within the bucket.
Option (B) utilizes a KMS (Key Management Service) managed customer master key, which is created and managed by AWS Key Management Service (KMS). This ensures that the master key used for client-side encryption is securely stored and managed within the KMS, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
Option (A) does not provide this level of security as it uses a client-side master key that could potentially be compromised or lost. Option (C) would also require additional infrastructure to manage the server-side encryption, which may not be feasible for all organizations. Option (D) is not a viable option as it involves storing the customer's encryption key on AWS servers, which goes against compliance requirements.
