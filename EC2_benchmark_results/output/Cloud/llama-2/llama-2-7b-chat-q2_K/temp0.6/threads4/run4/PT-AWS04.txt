Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation: When resharding a stream, the number of open shards is increased while keeping the existing instances and workers intact. If you want to achieve optimum performance in your application, you should launch six EC2 instances to handle the increased load. Launching more than six instances may result in unnecessary costs and complexity without significantly improving performance.
