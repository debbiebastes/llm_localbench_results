The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The best solution in this scenario is (A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
The correct answer is (A) because it provides a more comprehensive solution that addresses both the immediate security risk and long-term compliance needs of the company. Here are some reasons why this option is the best choice:
1. Immediate mitigation: The IT Security team must act quickly to patch the old EC2 instances to prevent any potential cyber attacks. Using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, they can easily deploy the necessary OS patches without having to manually configure each instance individually.
2. Compliance recording: To comply with audit requirements, it's crucial to record all changes made to patch and associated compliance statuses. By integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, the team can easily track and monitor any configuration changes across their infrastructure. This provides a comprehensive view of their environment, enabling them to identify potential security risks and take corrective action.
3. Long-term solution: While the initial patching process is crucial, it's equally important to have a long-term solution in place. AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager allows the team to schedule and manage patches across their environment more efficiently. By setting up AWS Config to record changes, they can ensure that any future configuration modifications are properly documented.
In summary, option (A) offers a more comprehensive solution that addresses both immediate security risks and long-term compliance needs, making it the most suitable choice for this scenario.
