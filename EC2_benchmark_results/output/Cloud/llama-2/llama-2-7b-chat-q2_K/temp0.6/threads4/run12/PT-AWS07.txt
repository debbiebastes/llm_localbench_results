A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day is (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation:
The performance issue during the start of the day can be attributed to the delay in scaling up the instances in the Auto Scaling group. By configuring a scheduled scaling policy, you can launch new instances before the start of the day, ensuring that there are sufficient instances available to handle the increased workload at the beginning of the day.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy is not the best option as it relies on predicting the usage patterns of the application and may lead to over- or under-provisioning of instances. Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy is also not the best option as it relies on the CPU utilization, which may not be an accurate measure of workload during the early hours of the day. Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization is not the best option either as it may lead to over-provisioning of instances during periods of low workload.
In conclusion, configuring a scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group is the most operationally efficient solution to ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day.
