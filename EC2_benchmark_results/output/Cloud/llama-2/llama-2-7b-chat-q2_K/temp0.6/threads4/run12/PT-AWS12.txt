A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The most cost-effective option would be (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This is because the application will be used for more than 3 years, and the upfront payment of $0.0075/hour for a 3-year term is less expensive than paying hourly for the entire term or for a shorter term with renewals. By committing to a longer term, the company can save money on the overall cost of the Reserved EC2 Instance.
