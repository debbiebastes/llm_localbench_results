Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation:
When resharding the Kinesis data stream, increasing the number of open shards from four to six will have a positive impact on performance. However, launching more than six EC2 instances may not result in improved performance as the additional instances will be idle most of the time, leading to wasted resources and increased costs. The optimal number of EC2 instances for your application would be determined by factors such as the volume of data processed per hour, the size and complexity of the data, and the throughput requirements of your application. Therefore, the answer is (D) six EC2 instances.
