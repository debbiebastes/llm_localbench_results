A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements would be option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach provides the following benefits:
1. Auditing: By tracking events in DynamoDB, you can capture changes made to data in near real-time, providing an audit trail of all actions taken on that data.
2. Automation: By setting up a rule in EventBridge, you can automate the process of capturing new changes and saving them to the other table in another region. This eliminates the need for manual intervention and reduces the likelihood of human error.
3. Scalability: As your application grows, so does your data volume. By using EventBridge, you can easily scale your auditing infrastructure to handle increased data volumes without having to manage multiple instances or services.
4. Security: By using a Lambda function as a rule target, you can ensure that any changes made to data are processed and validated before they are written to the other table. This provides an additional layer of security against unauthorized access or malicious activity.
In summary, option (C) is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements by providing a scalable, automated, secure, and auditable solution for capturing new changes made to data in DynamoDB.
