An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
Option (C): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
Explanation:
An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume provides persistent block storage for EC2 instances. It is the best choice for mission-critical workloads that require fast and reliable access to data. By attaching an EBS volume in your EC2 instance, you can ensure that your data is available when needed and is not affected by the instance's termination or failure.
To meet the requirement of storing backup data in a lifecycle policy, you can configure a policy in Amazon S3 to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA after 30 days. This will ensure that your data is stored in multiple Availability Zones and Regions, providing high availability and durability.
Option (A) uses instance store volumes, which are not recommended for mission-critical workloads as they are not persistently stored and can be lost upon instance termination. Option (B) uses EBS volumes, but does not provide the same level of data durability as Amazon S3 One Zone-IA. Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not available in all regions.
