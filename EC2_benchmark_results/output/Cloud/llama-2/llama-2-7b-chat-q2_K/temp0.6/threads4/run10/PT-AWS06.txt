A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The most likely root cause of this issue is (B) The endpoint request timed-out. When calling a Lambda function through an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration, if the underlying function takes too long to complete, the API Gateway may return a 502 Bad Gateway error to the caller. This is because the HTTP connection established between the client and the API Gateway times out after a certain period, causing the API Gateway to return an error. To troubleshoot this issue, the developer can check the Lambda function's execution logs for any errors or latency issues that may be causing the function to take longer than expected to complete.
