A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Explanation:
This approach is efficient because it uses AWS Config rules to detect the security risk automatically, without requiring manual intervention. The AWS Config rules can check for any security groups that allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range and update them with the corporate firewall IP address using an associated Systems Manager Automation document and AWS Lambda function. This ensures that any new security groups created by developers without proper approval are automatically remediated, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to company resources.
Option (B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances is not the most efficient approach as it would require manual configuration and setup, and may not detect any existing security groups that have already been created without approval. Option (C) Blocking the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL is also not the most efficient approach as it would only block new traffic from these sources, but would not remediate any existing security groups that may have been created without proper approval. Option (D) Using AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is also not the most efficient approach as it would require manual configuration and monitoring, and may not detect any existing security groups that have already been created without proper approval.
Therefore, option (A) is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk in AWS.
