A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.
Explanation:
In this scenario, the Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption to ensure that sensitive PII data is encrypted before it is stored in Amazon S3. By using a KMS-managed customer master key, the Security Engineer can ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the decryption keys, and that the keys are properly rotated and managed.
Option (A) is not the best choice because it would require the company to manage their own encryption keys on their end, which could lead to security breaches if the keys are not properly secured. Option (C) is also not recommended as it would require the company to provide their own encryption keys to AWS, which is not secure. Option (D) is the best choice as it ensures that sensitive data is encrypted before it is stored in S3 and that only authorized personnel have access to the decryption keys.
