The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The most suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Reasoning:
Option (A) involves deploying the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, which is a fully managed service that provides a single place to manage the configuration of AWS resources. This approach allows the IT Security team to quickly and easily deploy the patches across multiple EC2 instances without having to manually configure each instance individually.
Option (B) involves setting up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. While this approach can also be effective, it may not be as efficient or flexible as option (A), especially for large-scale environments.
Option (C) involves using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. However, this approach may not provide as much visibility into configuration changes as option (A), which integrates Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Option (D) involves configuring the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis. While this approach can help ensure that the patches are applied regularly, it may not provide as much visibility into configuration changes or be as flexible as option (A).
