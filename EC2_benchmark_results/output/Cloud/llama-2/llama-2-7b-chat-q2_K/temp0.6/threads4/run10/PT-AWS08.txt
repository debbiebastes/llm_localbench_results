An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.

Explanation:

An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume provides persistent block storage for EC2 instances, which meets the requirement of a mission-critical workload. Unlike instance store volumes, EBS volumes are not tied to a specific instance and can be attached to multiple instances throughout their lifetime. This means that if you need to scale your application or move it to another instance, you can simply detach the EBS volume and attach it to the new instance without any data loss.
Amazon S3 provides a scalable and durable object storage service that is ideal for storing backup data. By configuring a lifecycle policy on your EBS volume, you can automatically transition your objects from Amazon S3 to Amazon S3 Glacier or Amazon S3 One Zone-IA after 30 days, depending on your data retention needs.
Glacier and One Zone-IA are both designed for long-term data archiving and retrieval, providing low-cost storage for infrequently accessed data. By using these services, you can reduce the cost of storing and managing large amounts of backup data while still maintaining access to it when needed.
In summary, attaching an EBS volume in your EC2 instance provides a persistent and scalable block storage solution that meets the requirement of mission-critical workloads, while also providing options for long-term data archiving and retrieval through Amazon S3 and its associated services.
