A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements is option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Setting up an EventBridge rule will allow you to track all changes made to the original DynamoDB table and send those changes to another DynamoDB table in another region in real-time. This way, any changes made to the original table will be automatically mirrored to the new table, ensuring that both tables are up to date with the latest changes.
Option (A) is not ideal as it would require setting up a separate Accelerator instance for each DynamoDB table, which can incur additional costs and complexity. Option (B) is also not ideal as it would require manually syncing the two tables, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Option (D) is not ideal either, as it would require enabling DynamoDB Streams, which may not be necessary in this scenario.
