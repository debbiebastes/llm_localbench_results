Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation: When you reshard your stream, it means that the processing power of the application increases by adding more instances. The question states that the application is currently processing one Kinesis data stream with four shards and each instance has one KCL worker. To achieve optimum performance, you should launch six EC2 instances to increase the number of open shards. This will give your application enough processing power to handle the increased volume of data.
Option (D) 6 is the correct answer.
