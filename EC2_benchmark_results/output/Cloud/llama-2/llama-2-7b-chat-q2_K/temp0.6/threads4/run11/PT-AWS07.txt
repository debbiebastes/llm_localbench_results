A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
Explanation:
The application's performance is slow during the start of the day, indicating that there is high CPU or Memory utilization during this time. To address this issue, a scheduled scaling policy can be configured to launch new instances before the start of the day. This will ensure that there are sufficient instances available during peak usage hours and reduce the likelihood of poor performance due to high utilization.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy is not the best solution as it relies on predicting the future usage patterns, which can be challenging. Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on Memory utilization may also lead to suboptimal performance during peak hours. Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on CPU utilization is not recommended as it may lead to instances being launched with inadequate resources, resulting in poor performance.
Therefore, the most operationally efficient solution is to configure a Scheduled scaling policy to launch new instances before the start of the day.
