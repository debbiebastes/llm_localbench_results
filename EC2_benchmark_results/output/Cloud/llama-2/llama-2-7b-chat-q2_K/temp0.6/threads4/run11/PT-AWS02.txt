The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The most suitable solution in this scenario is (A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.

Rationale:

(A) is the best solution because it provides a comprehensive approach to addressing the security vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. By using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, the team can efficiently deploy OS patches across multiple EC2 instances without needing to manually log into each instance. Additionally, by integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, the team can record and track any configuration changes, providing auditable evidence of compliance.
Option (B) could also be a suitable solution, but it may not provide the same level of automation as option (A). With AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, the team would still need to manually install patches on each EC2 instance, which could be time-consuming and prone to human error.
Option (C) is also a viable solution, but it may not provide the same level of automation as options (A) or (B). With AWS Config, the team would need to manually configure and monitor each EC2 instance to ensure that patches are applied on a regular basis. This approach could be more time-consuming and error-prone than using Systems Manager.
Option (D) is not a suitable solution as it does not provide any automation for deploying patches across multiple EC2 instances. The team would still need to manually install patches on each instance, which could be time-consuming and prone to human error.
