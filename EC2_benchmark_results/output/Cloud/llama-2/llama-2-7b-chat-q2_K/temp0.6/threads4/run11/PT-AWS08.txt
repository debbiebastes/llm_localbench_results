An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.

Explanation:
To meet the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, you should attach an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume to your EC2 instance. An EBS volume provides block-level access to data and can be mounted as a file system on a Linux or Windows server.
You can store your backup data in Amazon S3, which offers a simple and cost-effective storage solution for a wide range of data types, including images, videos, audio files, and text documents. You can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects from Amazon S3 to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which provides a highly available and durable storage solution for archiving and long-term data retention.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads as they are designed for temporary use within an EC2 instance. Option (C) is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not available in all regions, so it may not be accessible for your organization. Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for persistent storage and can only be used within the lifetime of an EC2 instance.
