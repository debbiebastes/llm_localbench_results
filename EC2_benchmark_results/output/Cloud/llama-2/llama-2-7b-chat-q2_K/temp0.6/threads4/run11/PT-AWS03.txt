A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
This approach is efficient because it uses AWS Config rules, which are designed to simplify and automate configuration management tasks across AWS resources. By using AWS Config, you can easily identify and remediate security risks without having to manually search through and analyze each security group. Additionally, associating an Automation document with a Lambda function allows for more flexible and efficient remediation, as the Automation document can be triggered by any change to the security group or other AWS resources.
Option (B) is not the most efficient approach because it involves setting up a Transit VPC, which requires additional configuration and maintenance. Option (C) is also not the best approach because it only blocks traffic from the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which may not be comprehensive enough to address the security risk. Option (D) is also not the most efficient approach because it relies on AWS Shield, which may not be able to detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.
