The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
Option (A) provides a comprehensive solution that addresses the security risk and meets the audit requirements. Here's why:
1. Deploying patches using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager is a quick and efficient way to deploy patches across multiple EC2 instances. This reduces the time required for manual deployment, which can be resource-intensive and error-prone.
2. Integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana provides a robust solution for monitoring and tracking configuration changes. This allows the IT team to easily audit and report on any changes made to EC2 instances, ensuring compliance with security policies and regulatory requirements.
Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy patches for EC2 instances with old operating systems. While this option can help automate the patching process, it may not provide the same level of monitoring and tracking capabilities as Option (A).
Option (C) uses AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy OS patches for outdated EC2 instances. However, without proper monitoring and tracking, there is a higher risk of configuration changes going unnoticed.
Option (D) automatically installs OS patches on a weekly basis, but this approach may not provide sufficient protection against security risks that require immediate attention. By contrast, Option (A) provides a more proactive solution for mitigating security risks and meeting audit requirements.
