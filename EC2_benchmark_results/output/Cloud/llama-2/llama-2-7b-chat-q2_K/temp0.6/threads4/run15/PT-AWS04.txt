Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
D) 6

Rationale: When you reshard your stream, each shard processes a portion of the data. With six shards, each shard can process half of the total data, resulting in better performance and scalability. Launching more than six EC2 instances would not provide any additional performance benefits as each instance would be handling only a portion of the data.
