A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The most operationally efficient solution to ensure proper application performance at the beginning of the day is:
Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation:
The issue with the application's performance during the early morning hours can be attributed to several factors, including:
1. Instance startup and warming up of the applications: When the instances are launched, they take some time to warm up and become ready for use. This can cause slow performance during the early morning hours.
2. Increased workload: During peak working hours, the application experiences an increased workload, which can impact its performance.
To address these issues, a Scheduled scaling policy can be configured to launch new instances before the start of the day. This will ensure that there are enough instances available during peak hours to handle the increased workload, and the instances will have had time to warm up and become ready for use.
Option (C) is incorrect because it does not address the issue of warming up instances or the increased workload during peak hours. Option (D) is also incorrect because it does not take into account the need for additional instances to be launched before the start of the day.
