A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The most operationally efficient solution to implement is (C): Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
This approach allows the company to pre-launch instances during off-peak hours, typically outside of office hours, which can help ensure that the application has sufficient resources available at the beginning of the workday. By launching instances ahead of time, the company can also reduce the likelihood of performance issues caused by instance launch delays during peak usage periods. Additionally, this approach can help distribute load more evenly throughout the day and reduce the likelihood of overloading during peak hours.
Option (A) is not the best answer because predictive scaling policies rely on historical data to forecast future usage patterns, which may not accurately reflect actual usage patterns during off-peak hours. Option (B) is also not the best answer because dynamic scaling policies only launch new instances based on memory utilization, and may not ensure sufficient resources are available at the beginning of the day. Option (D) is not the best answer because dynamic scaling policies rely on CPU utilization to determine when to launch new instances, which may not accurately reflect usage patterns during off-peak hours.
