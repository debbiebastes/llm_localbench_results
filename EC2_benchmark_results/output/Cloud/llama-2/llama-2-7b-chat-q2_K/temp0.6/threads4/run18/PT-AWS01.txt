A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
B - Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key

Explanation: The Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption using the AWS Key Management Service (KMS). This will ensure that the sensitive PII data is encrypted on the client-side before being sent to AWS. By using a KMS-managed customer master key, the company can retain full control over the encryption keys and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.
Option A is not the best choice as it would require sending the unencrypted data to AWS for processing, which could lead to security breaches. Option C is also not recommended as it would require the company to provide its encryption keys to AWS, which could compromise security controls. Option D is also not a viable option as it would require the company to use an external key management service, which could increase complexity and costs.
