A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements would be option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach provides the following benefits:

1. **Event-driven architecture**: By using Amazon EventBridge, you can decouple your application from the need to constantly poll or query DynamoDB for new changes. Instead, you can simply set up a rule that listens for events and processes them as needed.
2. **Automated processing**: By setting up a Lambda function as a target for the EventBridge rule, you can automate the process of saving new changes to the other DynamoDB table. This ensures that new changes are processed in real-time without requiring any manual intervention.
3. **Scalability**: Since EventBride and Lambda functions can scale independently, you can adjust the scaling parameters for each component separately to optimize performance and cost.
4. **Ease of implementation**: Setting up an EventBridge rule and a Lambda function is relatively straightforward and can be implemented quickly and easily, compared to other options like enabling DynamoDB streams or setting up a custom synchronization process.

Therefore, option (C) Create an Amazon EventBride (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table, is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements.
