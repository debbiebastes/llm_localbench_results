An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.

Explanation:

An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume provides persistent block storage that can be used for mission-critical workloads. By attaching an EBS volume to an EC2 instance, you can ensure that the data is stored in a persistent and durable manner, which is ideal for storing backup data that needs to be retained for 30 days or more.
Using Amazon S3 to store your backup data is also a good idea because it provides a scalable, secure, and highly available storage service. You can configure a lifecycle policy in Amazon S3 to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which will help reduce storage costs by moving cold data to a lower-cost storage tier.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not intended for mission-critical workloads and do not provide the same level of durability as EBS or SATA volumes. Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not designed to store large amounts of backup data, and it may not provide the same level of security and availability as Amazon S3.
