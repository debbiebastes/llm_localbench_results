A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The most cost-effective option would be:

C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:
When you choose to use the Standard Reserved Instance (SRI) pricing for a 3-year term, you'll get better pricing compared to using On-Demand pricing or Convertible Reserved Instance (CRI) pricing. The reason is that Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers discounts for committing to a longer term. Additionally, SRI pricing allows you to save on both the upfront cost and the recurring costs over the term of your agreement.
In summary:
* If you only need the instance for 1 year, option (D) is the most cost-effective choice.
* If you need the instance for more than 3 years, option (C) is the most cost-effective choice.
Note that all options have different pricing models, and it's important to evaluate your needs and choose the option that best fits your budget and usage patterns before making a decision.
