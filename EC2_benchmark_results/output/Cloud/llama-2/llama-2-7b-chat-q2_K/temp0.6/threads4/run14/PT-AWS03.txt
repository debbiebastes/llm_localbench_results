A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and then associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Explanation:
Option (A) uses AWS Config rules to continuously monitor the security groups for any inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which is a well-known source of malicious traffic. Once a security group with inbound traffic from this range is detected, AWS Config can automatically update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address using an associated Systems Manager Automation document and AWS Lambda function. This ensures that only authorized traffic is allowed through the security groups, while preventing any malicious traffic from entering the network.
Option (B) does not address the immediate risk of inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, as it would take time to set up a Transit VPC and connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances. Option (C) is not efficient as it only blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACLs, which may not be able to detect all malicious traffic sources. Option (D) may not provide real-time detection of security risks, as it relies on manual monitoring and detection by AWS Shield.
In conclusion, option (A) is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk, as it uses AWS Config rules to continuously monitor and update security groups in real-time to prevent any malicious traffic from entering the network.
