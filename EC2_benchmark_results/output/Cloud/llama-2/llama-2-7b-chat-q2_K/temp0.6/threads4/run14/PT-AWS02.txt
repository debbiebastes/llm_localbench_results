The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Rationale:
(A) Using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager to deploy OS patches for outdated EC2 instances is the most suitable solution because it allows the IT Security team to quickly identify and address security vulnerabilities in their infrastructure. By integrating with Amazon QuickSight and Kibana, the team can also record and track any configuration changes related to patch management. This helps ensure compliance audits are properly documented and easier to conduct.
While option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy patches for EC2 instances with old operating systems, it does not provide a centralized solution for managing patches across multiple instances or recording changes made to the configuration. Option (C) uses AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, but like option (B), it does not provide a comprehensive solution for managing patches and tracking changes. Option (D) is not a feasible solution as automatic patch installation on a weekly basis may not be flexible enough to address urgent security vulnerabilities.
