A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
Using EC2 instances will provide more processing power for your backend systems, while the ELB will distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances, ensuring that no single instance is overwhelmed. Additionally, Auto Scaling can automatically adjust the number of instances based on traffic demand, providing a highly available and scalable architecture for your platform.
Option (B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway can also help protect the backend systems from traffic spikes by limiting the number of requests that can be made to the platform at any given time. Result caching can also help reduce the load on the backend systems by storing frequently requested data in a cache, reducing the number of requests made to the platform.
Option (C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache is not the best option for protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes. While CloudFront can provide some caching functionality, it may not be able to handle the increased traffic that comes with a price surge. Additionally, CloudFront may not be able to handle the load of a large number of users accessing the platform simultaneously.
Option (D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC is not a practical solution for protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes. While this option may provide some degree of scalability and security, it may not be able to handle the increased traffic that comes with a price surge. Additionally, moving the Lambda function to a VPC may increase latency and reduce performance.
