A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements would be option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach provides a centralized, automated, and scalable solution for tracking and processing changes made to items in both DynamoDB tables.
Here's why this option is the best fit:
1. Centralized management: With EventBridge, you can create a single point of truth for all events across your application, making it easier to manage and maintain.
2. Automated processing: By setting up an EventBridge rule with a Lambda function as a target, you can automatically process new changes made to items in DynamoDB without having to manually update the other table.
3. Scalability: As your application grows, you can easily scale EventBridge and your Lambda function to handle increased event volumes.
4. Cost-effective: Unlike option (A), which requires additional infrastructure to accelerate DynamoDB writes, or option (B), which involves using PITR, EventBridge is a cost-effective solution that leverages Amazon's highly available infrastructure.
5. Ease of implementation: Setting up an EventBridge rule and a Lambda function is relatively straightforward, especially if you have experience with AWS services like CloudWatch Events and Lambda functions.
In summary, option (C) offers the most ideal solution for tracking and processing changes made to items in both DynamoDB tables, providing a scalable, automated, and cost-effective approach that meets the requirements while being easy to implement and maintain.
