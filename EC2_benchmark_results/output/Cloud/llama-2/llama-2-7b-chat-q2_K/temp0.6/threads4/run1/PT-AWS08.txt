An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (A): Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
An organization needs a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, such as databases or data warehousing. An instance store volume is the best option for this requirement because it provides a high level of durability and availability. However, since the backup data will be stored in Amazon S3, which has lower costs but lower performance, it makes sense to use an instance store volume that can provide a higher level of throughput than Amazon S3.
Option (B) is incorrect because EBS volumes are not optimized for storing large amounts of data and do not provide the same level of durability as instance store volumes. Option (C) is also incorrect because while One Zone-IA provides lower costs than Glacier, it does not provide the same level of durability or availability.
Option (D) is incorrect because Amazon S3 does not support transitioning data to One Zone-IA.
In summary, option (A) is the best choice because it provides a balance between performance, durability, and cost for mission-critical workloads.
