A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The most operationally efficient solution to ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day is to configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group, as per option (C). This would allow you to launch new instances before the start of the workday, ensuring that there are sufficient resources available for the increased usage during this period.
Option (A), Configure a Predictive scaling policy, might not be the best solution as it relies on predicting the usage patterns, which can sometimes be inaccurate or unreliable. Option (B), Configure a Dynamic scaling policy, while effective in adjusting the instance count based on utilization, might not be ideal during peak hours when the usage is higher than usual. Option (D), Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch instances based on CPU utilization, could result in instances being launched without sufficient memory resources, leading to slower performance.
