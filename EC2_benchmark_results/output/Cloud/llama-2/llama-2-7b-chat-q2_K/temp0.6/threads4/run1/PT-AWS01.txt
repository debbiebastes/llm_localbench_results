A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:
AWS provides two types of encryption for Amazon S3 buckets: server-side encryption and client-side encryption.
Client-side encryption means that the data is encrypted on the client's (user) side before it is uploaded to S3, using a private key known only to the user. This type of encryption is suitable for sensitive or confidential data that must be kept completely secret from the server.
On the other hand, server-side encryption means that the data is encrypted on the AWS servers before it is stored in S3. The master key is managed by AWS and is not exposed to the user. This type of encryption is suitable for most data as it provides an additional layer of security by encrypting the data both in transit and at rest.
To comply with regulatory requirements, the Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption using a KMS-managed customer master key. This will ensure that the sensitive information is encrypted on the user's side, and the master key is managed by AWS Key Management Service (KMS), which provides secure key management for the entire organization.
Option (A) is not the best choice as it does not provide an additional layer of security as KMS-managed customer master key does. Option (C) is also not recommended as it exposes the user to the risk of losing their encryption key, which can lead to data breaches. Option (D) is not a suitable choice as it requires the user to provide their own encryption key, which may not be secure or compliant with regulatory requirements.
