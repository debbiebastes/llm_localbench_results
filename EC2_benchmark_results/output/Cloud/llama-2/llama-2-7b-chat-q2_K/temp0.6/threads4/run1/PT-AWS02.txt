The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The most suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes. This solution provides the following benefits:
1. Automated patch management: With AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, the IT Security team can automatically deploy OS patches for outdated EC2 instances without manual intervention. This reduces the risk of human error or oversight, ensuring that all instances are properly secured.
2. Compliance tracking: By integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, the team can easily track and record any configuration changes related to patch management. This provides a clear audit trail for compliance purposes, ensuring that the company is meeting its regulatory obligations.
3. Centralized management: AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager allows the IT Security team to manage patches across multiple EC2 instances from a single console. This streamlines the patch management process and reduces the complexity of managing multiple instances.
4. Consistency and repeatability: By using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, the team can ensure that all EC2 instances are updated with the same patches in a consistent and repeatable manner. This reduces the risk of errors or oversights during the patching process.
In summary, option (A) provides the most suitable solution for this scenario, as it offers automated patch management, compliance tracking, centralized management, and consistency and repeatability in the patching process.
