A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The most cost-effective option would be (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option provides the best value for long-term commitments and can help you save up to 75% compared to On-Demand pricing. By committing to a 3-year term, you can also avoid any upfront costs or price increases over that time period.
Option (A) is not the most cost-effective option because it requires an upfront payment that may not be justified for shorter term commitments. Option (B) is also not the best choice because it does not provide any upfront discounts or price stability over a 3-year term. Option (D) is also not the most cost-effective option because it requires annual renewals, which could result in price increases each year.
