A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements is option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, and set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach allows for real-time monitoring of changes made to items in both tables, enabling you to easily capture and record all changes made to both tables.
Option (A) would require additional setup and maintenance to enable DynamoDB Accelerator, which might increase costs and complexity. Option (B) would also require manual synchronization of data between regions, which could be error-prone and difficult to manage. Option (D) is similar to option (C), but it uses DynamoDB Streams instead of Amazon CloudWatch Events, which might not provide the same level of real-time monitoring capabilities.
