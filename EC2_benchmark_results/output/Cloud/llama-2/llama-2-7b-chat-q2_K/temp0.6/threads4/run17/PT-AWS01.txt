A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The answer is (B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:
The Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key to ensure the sensitive PII data of patients remains secure. This approach ensures that the patient data is encrypted on the client side before it reaches AWS, and the KMS-managed customer master key is used to encrypt the data.
Option (A) is incorrect because implementing client-side encryption with a client-side master key does not provide enough security for sensitive PII data. Option (C) is also incorrect because server-side encryption with a customer provided key is not recommended as it can lead to unauthorized access to the encrypted data. Option (D) is incorrect because implementing server-side encryption with a customer provided key is not secure and can lead to unauthorized access to the encrypted data.
