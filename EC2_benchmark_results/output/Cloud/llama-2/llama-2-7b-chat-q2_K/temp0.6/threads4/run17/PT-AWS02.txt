The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Reason: The AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager provides a simple, secure, and scalable way to manage the patching process across multiple instances. By integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, the team can easily monitor and track all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses for audit purposes. This solution offers the most efficient and effective way to address the vulnerability, while also providing a comprehensive record of any changes made to patch configurations.
Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, which can deploy OS patches on EC2 instances with old operating systems. However, this option does not provide as much visibility into configuration changes as Amazon QuickSight and Kibana integration. Option (C) uses AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy OS patches on outdated EC2 instances. While this solution is efficient, it does not offer the same level of monitoring and tracking capabilities as Amazon QuickSight and Kibana integration. Option (D) is not a suitable solution as it only configures the automatic installation of OS patches on a weekly basis, which may not address the immediate security risk.
