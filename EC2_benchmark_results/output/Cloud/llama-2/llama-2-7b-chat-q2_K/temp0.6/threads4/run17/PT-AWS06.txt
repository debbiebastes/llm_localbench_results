A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 

The most likely root cause of this issue is (B) The endpoint request timed-out. When a Lambda function is invoked, it can take some time for the function to execute and return its output. If the request times out while waiting for the function to complete, the client will receive a 502 Bad Gateway error.
In this scenario, the developer received a result from the underlying function in XML format, indicating that the function did complete successfully, but the client timed out waiting for it to do so. To troubleshoot the issue, the developer can check the Lambda function's execution logs to see if there are any signs of a timeout or error during the function's execution.
