An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.
Here's why:
An EBS volume provides persistent block storage that can be used for mission-critical workloads. By attaching an EBS volume to your existing EC2 instance, you can store your backup data on the EBS volume and use Amazon S3 to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days.
Option (A) is not a good choice because instance store volumes are designed for temporary storage and are not suitable for mission-critical workloads. Option (C) is also not a good choice because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a new service that is still in preview, and it may not be available in all regions.
Option (D) is also not a good choice because instance store volumes are designed for temporary storage and are not suitable for mission-critical workloads.
