Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation: When you reshard your Kinesis data stream, it is important to consider the number of open shards that will achieve optimum performance. Increasing the number of open shards beyond what is necessary may actually degrade performance rather than improve it. By considering factors such as the type and volume of data being processed, network bandwidth, and instance type, you can determine the optimal number of EC2 instances required to handle your workload efficiently.
In this case, since the existing stream has four shards and six open shards will increase the processing capacity without overloading the instances, it is reasonable to launch six EC2 instances to achieve optimum performance. Launching more than six instances would not necessarily improve performance, as each additional instance would only provide a limited increase in processing power without significantly impacting the overall throughput of the stream.
