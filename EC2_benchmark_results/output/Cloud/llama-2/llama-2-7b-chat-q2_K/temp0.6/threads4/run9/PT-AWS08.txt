An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.

Explanation:

An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume provides a persistent block storage that can be used for mission-critical workloads. You can attach an EBS volume to your existing EC2 instance, and use Amazon S3 to store your backup data. To meet the requirement of storing the data in a separate storage tier after 30 days, you can configure a lifecycle policy in Amazon S3 to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier or Amazon S3 One Zone-IA. These storage tiers provide a low-cost, long-term storage solution that can be used for data archiving and backup workloads.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads due to their volatile nature. Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not yet available in all regions.
Therefore, the recommended solution is to attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance and use Amazon S3 to store your backup data, with a lifecycle policy configured to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier or Amazon S3 One Zone-IA after 30 days.
