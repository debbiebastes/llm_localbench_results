A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The most likely root cause of this issue is (B) The endpoint request timed-out. When a Lambda function is invoked through an Amazon API Gateway, the function invocation sends a request to the underlying Lambda function. If the response from the Lambda function takes too long to return, the API Gateway will time out the request and return a 502 Bad Gateway error to the client. This can happen if the underlying Lambda function is taking longer than expected to execute or if there are issues with the underlying infrastructure. To troubleshoot this issue, the developer can check the Lambda function's execution logs for any errors or latency issues that may be causing the delay.
