A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

The correct answer is (B): Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.
Explanation:
In this scenario, the web application needs to store sensitive PII data of patients in AWS S3 buckets. To ensure that the data remains secure and compliant with regulatory requirements, the Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption using a KMS (Key Management Service) managed customer master key. This way, the encryption keys are managed and secured by AWS KMS, ensuring that the sensitive data is never exposed to unauthorized parties.
Option (A) is not the best choice because it would require storing an unencrypted version of the PII data on the client-side, which is a non-compliant approach. Option (C) is also not recommended because it would involve storing the encryption keys with AWS, which may not be compliant with regulatory requirements.
Option (D) is not a feasible choice as well, as it would require the customer to provide their own encryption key, which can be difficult to manage and secure, especially for sensitive data like PII.
