Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation: When resharding the stream, you increased the number of open shards from four to six. This means that each instance can handle a higher volume of data before it needs to split the data into smaller chunks for processing. To achieve optimum performance, you should launch six EC2 instances to process your application's workload. This will allow you to take advantage of the increased processing power provided by the additional shards without overloading any individual instance.
