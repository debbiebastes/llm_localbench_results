The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
In this scenario, the IT Security team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk by deploying patches to the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The best solution is to use AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager to deploy the patches in a secure and efficient manner. This tool allows for easy management of system configuration, patches, and compliance reports. Additionally, integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana will provide an audit trail of all changes made to patches and associated compliance statuses.
Option (B) is not the best solution as it involves setting up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, which may take longer to deploy patches compared to using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Option (C) also involves setting up AWS Config, which may add complexity and overhead for this scenario. Option (D) is not a feasible solution as it involves configuring the EC2 instances to automatically install patches on a weekly basis, which may take too long to mitigate the security risk.
