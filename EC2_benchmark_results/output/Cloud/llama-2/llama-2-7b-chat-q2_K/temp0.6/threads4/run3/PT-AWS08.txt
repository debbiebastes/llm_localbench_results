An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Reasoning:
An EBS volume provides persistent block storage, which is suitable for mission-critical workloads. You can attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance and use Amazon S3 to store your backup data. To comply with the requirement of storing backup data after 30 days, you can configure a lifecycle policy in Amazon S3 to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. Amazon S3 Glacier provides low-cost, long-term archival storage that is suitable for storing large amounts of data that are infrequently accessed.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not intended for mission-critical workloads and do not provide the same level of durability as EBS volumes. Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is designed for low-latency access and is not suitable for long-term archival storage. Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not intended for mission-critical workloads and do not provide the same level of durability as EBS volumes.
