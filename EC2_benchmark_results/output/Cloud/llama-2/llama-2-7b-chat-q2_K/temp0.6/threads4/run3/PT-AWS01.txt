A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The Security Engineer should implement option (B): Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This will ensure that the sensitive PII data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, while also meeting compliance requirements by using a KMS-managed customer master key. By not storing the unencrypted data on AWS, the Security Engineer can avoid any potential security breaches or non-compliance issues.
