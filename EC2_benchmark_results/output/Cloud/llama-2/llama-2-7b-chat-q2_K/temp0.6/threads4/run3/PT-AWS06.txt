A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The most likely root cause of this issue is (B) The endpoint request timed-out. When a Lambda function is invoked through an Amazon API Gateway proxy, the API Gateway handles the underlying Lambda function invocation and returns the result to the client. However, if the response from the underlying function takes too long to return, the API Gateway may time out the request, resulting in a 502 Bad Gateway error being returned to the client. This is more likely to occur during heavy loads or when the Lambda function itself experiences delays in processing the request. Therefore, option (B) is the most likely root cause of this issue.
