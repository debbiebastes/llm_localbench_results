A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The answer is (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
Explanation:
The application is slow at the beginning of the day, which suggests that there might be a delay in spinning up new instances or a delay in the startup scripts of the instances. By configuring a Scheduled scaling policy, you can launch new instances a few hours before the start of the workday, ensuring that they are available and ready for use when the workday starts. This would help improve the performance of the application during peak usage hours.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy is not the most operationally efficient solution as it relies on predicting the future usage patterns of the application, which can be challenging and may lead to suboptimal scaling decisions. Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy is also not the best option as it would launch new instances based on memory utilization only, which might result in instances that are too small for the workload during peak hours. Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch instances based on CPU utilization is also not recommended as it could lead to instances that are underutilized during peak hours and overutilized during off-peak hours.
