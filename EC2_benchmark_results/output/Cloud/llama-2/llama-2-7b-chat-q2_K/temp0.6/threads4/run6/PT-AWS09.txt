A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
The best option to protect the backend systems of the trading platform from traffic spikes is (B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
API Gateway can handle a large volume of incoming requests by using caching to store frequently-accessed data in memory, reducing the number of calls to the underlying APIs. By enabling throttling limits, you can also limit the number of requests that can be made to the backend systems within a certain time frame, preventing overload and ensuring that critical services remain available.
Option (A) would require significant changes to the architecture of the platform, as well as ongoing maintenance and scaling costs. Option (C) while providing some caching benefits, is not as effective as throttling limits in preventing traffic spikes. Option (D) would only provide protection for the Lambda function, leaving other backend systems vulnerable during traffic spikes.
