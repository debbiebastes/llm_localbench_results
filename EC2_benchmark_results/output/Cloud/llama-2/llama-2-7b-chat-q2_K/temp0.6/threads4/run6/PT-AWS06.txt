A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B): The endpoint request timed-out.

When a Lambda function is invoked through an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration, the request is proxied to the underlying Lambda function. However, the timing out of the underlying function can cause a 502 Bad Gateway error to be returned to the client. This can happen when the Lambda function takes too long to execute, causing the client-side Amazon API Gateway instance to time out.
Option (B) is the most likely root cause because it explains why the issue occurs when the underlying function is properly returning results in XML format. It also aligns with the symptoms described in the question, where the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error but the underlying function functions correctly.
