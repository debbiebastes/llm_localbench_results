The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The most suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
Option (A) involves using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager to deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. This tool allows you to manage and automate the deployment of patches, configurations, and other management tasks across your AWS infrastructure. By integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, you can also record and track any configuration changes.
Option (B) involves setting up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. While this tool can help automate the deployment of patches, it may not provide as detailed reporting capabilities as Amazon QuickSight with Kibana.
Option (C) uses AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. However, without additional tools like Amazon QuickSight and Kibana, you may not be able to record and track configuration changes in as much detail as needed for audit purposes.
Option (D) involves configuring the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis. While this can help ensure that your EC2 instances are up-to-date, it does not provide any additional reporting or compliance benefits.
