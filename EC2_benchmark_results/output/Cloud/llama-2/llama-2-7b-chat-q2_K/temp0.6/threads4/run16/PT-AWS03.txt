A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is:

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Explanation:
In this scenario, using AWS Config rules to detect and update security groups is the most efficient way to automatically remediate the security risk. AWS Config allows you to automate configuration management tasks across your AWS infrastructure, including updating security groups. By associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule, you can create an action that will update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address whenever it detects inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. This way, any unauthorized access attempts will be blocked automatically without any manual intervention.
Option (B) is not the most efficient solution as it would require manual configuration of a Transit VPC and manual creation of security groups for each EC2 instance. Option (C) is also not the most efficient solution as it would require manual configuration of Network ACLs, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Option (D) is not a feasible solution as AWS Shield is primarily designed to monitor and protect against DDoS attacks, rather than detecting security risks in security groups.
