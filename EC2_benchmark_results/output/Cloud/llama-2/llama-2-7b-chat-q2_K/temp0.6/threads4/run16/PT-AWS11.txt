Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).

Event-driven architecture is a software architecture pattern that enables you to build applications as a collection of independent components, each with its own responsibilities and behaviors. By using event-driven architecture, you can decouple the components of your application architecture, making it easier to develop, maintain, and scale your applications.
Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications. It provides a way to define events, handle event processing, and trigger actions based on events. With EventBridge, you can create and manage events, configure event filtering and routing, and set up event-driven workflows across your application architecture.
Option (A), Amazon SQS, is a message queuing service that enables you to decouple applications and services by providing a reliable messaging system between systems. However, it does not enable event-driven architecture in the same way as EventBridge.
Option (C), Amazon SNS, is an AWS service that provides real-time distributed data processing and event-driven workflows. While it can be used for building event-driven applications, it is not the primary focus of the service like it is with EventBridge.
Option (D), Amazon Kinesis, is a streaming data analytics service that enables you to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data from various sources, such as applications, IoT devices, and more. While it can be used for building event-driven applications, its primary focus is on handling real-time streaming data rather than enabling event-driven architecture.
