A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The best answer is (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
Explanation:
When using the Reserved EC2 Instance model, you have two options to choose from: Convertible Reserved Instances and Standard Reserved Instances. Of these, Standard Reserved Instances are more cost-effective in the long run if you plan to use the instance for more than 3 years.
Standard Reserved Instances require an upfront payment that is lower compared to Convertible Reserved Instances. Moreover, you can save even more money by committing to a longer term (in this case, 3 years). This means that you'll be eligible for the lowest prices offered by AWS.
On the other hand, Convertible Reserved Instances offer flexibility in terms of instance type and region changes, but they come at a higher cost. You can change the instance type and region once during the term of your agreement, which could help if you need to move your instance to a different region or upgrade to a different instance type.
In summary, if you plan to use the EC2 instance for more than 3 years, Standard Reserved Instances are the most cost-effective option. However, it's essential to weigh your options carefully and consider factors like flexibility and potential future needs before making a decision.
