A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
Option (C) Configuring a scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day is the MOST operationally efficient solution to ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day. This will allow the company to launch new instances in advance, giving them time to warm up and reach their optimal performance before the start of the workday.
Option (A) Configuring a predictive scaling policy is not as effective as it relies on historical data to make predictions about future performance, which may not always be accurate. Option (B) Configure a dynamic scaling policy based on memory utilization can also lead to suboptimal performance during the start of the day if the instances are launched too late. Option (D) Configuring a dynamic scaling policy based on CPU utilization is also not recommended as it may cause instances to be launched that are not fully utilized, leading to inefficiencies.
By launching new instances before the start of the workday through a scheduled scaling policy, the company can ensure that their application has sufficient resources from the beginning of the day and improve overall performance.
