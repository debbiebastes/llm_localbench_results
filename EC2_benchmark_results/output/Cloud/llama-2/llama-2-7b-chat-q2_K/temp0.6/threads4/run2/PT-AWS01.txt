A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The best answer is (B): Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.
Explanation:
In this scenario, the Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption using a Key Management Service (KMS) managed customer master key to protect sensitive patient data stored in AWS S3 buckets. This approach ensures that the encryption keys are securely managed and rotated regularly, as well as providing an additional layer of security for the unencrypted data.
By using KMS-managed customer master key, the company can ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the encryption keys, preventing unauthorized access or data breaches. This approach also aligns with industry compliance regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, which require organizations to implement appropriate security measures to protect sensitive personal data.
In contrast, options (A) and (C) are not recommended because they do not provide the same level of security as KMS-managed encryption. Option (D) is also not recommended as it may not provide adequate security controls for managing and rotating encryption keys.
