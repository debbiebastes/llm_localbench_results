An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The right answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Using Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation: An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume is a separate block device that provides persistent storage for AWS instances. Unlike an instance store, which is stored on the same hardware as the instance's operating system and applications, an EBS volume is stored on a separate storage array and can be detached from an instance at any time without affecting the instance itself. This makes it ideal for storing mission-critical data that needs to persist even if the instance fails or is terminated.
By using Amazon S3 to store your backup data, you can take advantage of its scalability, durability, and low costs. You can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which is a highly available and cost-effective storage service for archiving and long-term storage of large amounts of data.
Option (A) is not the best choice because instance store volumes are not designed for long-term storage of mission-critical data. They are more expensive than EBS volumes and have lower performance characteristics that may affect the performance of your workloads.
Option (C) is not recommended because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a new service that is still in preview, and it may not be available in all regions or with all types of storage classes. It's best to use Amazon S3 Standard or Amazon S3 Glacier for long-term archival storage of mission-critical data.
Option (D) is the best choice because instance store volumes are designed for temporary storage of an EC2 instance, and they are not suitable for long-term storage of mission-critical data. By using EBS volumes instead, you can ensure that your data persists even if the instance fails or is terminated.
