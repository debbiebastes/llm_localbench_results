A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk would be option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. This approach offers several advantages:

1. Automation: By using AWS Config, you can create automation processes that are triggered by specific events, such as changes to security groups. This saves time and reduces the risk of human error.
2. Consistency: With AWS Config, you can ensure that all resources in your environment are configured consistently and according to established policies.
3. Scalability: As your infrastructure grows, AWS Config can scale with it, making it easier to manage and maintain security across multiple environments.
4. Flexibility: AWS Config supports a wide range of technologies and services, including AWS Lambda functions, which can be used to automate remediation processes.
5. Monitoring: AWS Config provides detailed logs and analytics that enable you to monitor and track changes to your infrastructure, helping you identify potential security issues before they become critical.
6. Integration: By integrating AWS Config with other AWS services, such as AWS Lambda or AWS CloudFormation, you can create a comprehensive security management workflow that covers all aspects of your infrastructure.
In summary, using AWS Config rules to automatically detect and remediate security groups that allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is the most efficient way to address this security risk.
