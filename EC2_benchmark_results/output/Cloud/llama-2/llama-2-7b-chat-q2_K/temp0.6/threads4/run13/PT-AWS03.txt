A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
Option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is using AWS Config rules to detect whether there are any security groups allowing inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and then updating those groups with the corporate firewall IP address using an AWS Lambda function associated with an AWS Config rule. This approach allows for efficient and consistent remediation of security risks across the organization without requiring manual intervention.
Option (B): Setting up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances is not the most efficient way to automate remediation as it requires manual configuration and validation of each new EC2 instance, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.
Option (C): Blocking the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL is not a scalable solution as it requires manual configuration for each new security group, and it does not address the root cause of the problem.
Option (D): Using AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is not the most efficient way to automate remediation as it requires manual intervention and validation for each new security group, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.


Explanation:
Option (A) is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk because it leverages AWS Config rules to detect any security groups that allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and then updates those groups with the corporate firewall IP address using an AWS Lambda function associated with an AWS Config rule. This approach allows for efficient and consistent remediation of security risks across the organization without requiring manual intervention.
Option (B) is not the most efficient way to automate remediation as it requires manual configuration and validation of each new EC2 instance, which can be time-consuming and error-
