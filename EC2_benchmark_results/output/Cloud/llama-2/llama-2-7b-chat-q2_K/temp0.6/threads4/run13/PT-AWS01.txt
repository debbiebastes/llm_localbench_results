A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
In this scenario, the Security Engineer should implement (B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach ensures that sensitive PII data remains encrypted even when it is being transmitted or stored in AWS. By using a KMS-managed customer master key, the company can control the encryption keys and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
Explanation:
(A) Implementing client-side encryption with a client-side master key can lead to a number of security risks, such as unauthorized access to the encryption key or data breaches during transmission. By using a KMS-managed customer master key, the company can maintain control over the encryption keys and ensure that they are securely stored and managed.
(C) Server-side encryption with a customer provided key is not recommended for sensitive PII data, as it may lead to security risks such as unauthorized access to the encryption key or data breaches during transmission. Using a KMS-managed key ensures that the encryption keys are securely stored and managed, reducing the risk of security breaches.
(D) Implementing server-side encryption with a customer provided key is not recommended for sensitive PII data, as it may lead to security risks such as unauthorized access to the encryption key or data breaches during transmission. By using a KMS-managed key, the company can maintain control over the encryption keys and ensure that they are securely stored and managed, reducing the risk of security breaches.
Conclusion:
In this scenario, implementing client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key is the best approach to ensuring the security of sensitive PII data in transit and at rest. By using a KMS-managed key, the company can maintain control over the encryption keys and ensure that they are securely stored and managed, reducing the risk of security breaches.
