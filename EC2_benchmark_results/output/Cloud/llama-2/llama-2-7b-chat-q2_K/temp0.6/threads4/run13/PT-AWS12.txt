A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The answer is (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
Explanation: If the application will be used for more than 3 years, it would be more cost-effective to use a Reserved EC2 Instance with no upfront payment for a 3-year term. This is because the Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing model requires an upfront payment that is higher than the standard Reserved Instance pricing model. By not paying an upfront fee, the company can save money on the initial cost of using the Reserved EC2 Instance.
Option (A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term would provide the best value if the application is only going to be used for a year, but it becomes more expensive than other options as the term length increases. Option (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term would also provide good value if the application is expected to be used for more than 1 year, but it might not be the most cost-effective option for longer terms. Option (D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year would provide the lowest upfront cost, but the annual fees may be higher than other options.
