A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements is option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
Here's why:
Option (A), Setting up DynamoDB Accelerator, is not necessary for this use case as it is primarily used for query optimization. Option (B), Enabling Point-in-Time Recovery, can be complex and may require additional resources and expertise to set up correctly. Option (D), Enable DynamoDB Streams, is similar to option (C) but requires more configuration and setup.
The ideal solution is to create an EventBridge rule that tracks events in DynamoDB, such as item created or updated. The rule can trigger a Lambda function that saves the new changes to the other table in another region. This approach allows for near real-time synchronization of data between the two tables without incurring additional hardware costs or complexity.
