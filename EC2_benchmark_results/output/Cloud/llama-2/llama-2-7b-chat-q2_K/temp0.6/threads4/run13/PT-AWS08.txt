An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (A): Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
An instance store volume is a type of block storage that is attached directly to an EC2 instance, providing faster performance compared to other storage options. It is the best option for mission-critical workloads that require high throughput and low latency. Since you need to store backup data, using an instance store volume will provide faster access to the data you need.
Moreover, Amazon S3 provides a scalable and durable storage solution that can handle large amounts of data. You can configure a lifecycle policy in Amazon S3 to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which is a cold storage option that provides very low costs for archiving data.
Option (B) is incorrect because EBS volumes are designed for block-level operations and do not offer the same level of performance as instance store volumes. Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a suitable solution for mission-critical workloads that require high throughput and low latency.
Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are only available in select availability zones, which may limit their use in certain scenarios.
