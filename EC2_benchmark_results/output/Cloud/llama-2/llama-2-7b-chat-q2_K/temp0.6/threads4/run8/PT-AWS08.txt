An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The best option for meeting the above requirement is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Here's why:

Backup data storage: You can attach an EBS volume to your EC2 instance, which provides a highly available and durable storage solution for your backup data. EBS volumes are designed to provide high-performance and reliability for workloads that require persistent storage.
Data lifecycle management: Once you have attached the EBS volume, you can configure a lifecycle policy in Amazon S3 to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. This will allow you to store your backup data in a more cost-effective and durable storage solution while still maintaining easy access to your most recent backups.

Therefore, option (B) is the best choice for meeting the requirements outlined in the question.
