A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution to ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day is:
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
Explanation:
When the office hours begin, there is an influx of users using the CRM application, which can cause performance issues due to the high load on the servers. To mitigate this issue, it is more efficient to launch new instances before the start of the day. This will allow the instances to have time to spin up and get ready for the increased workload before office hours begin.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy is not the most efficient solution as it relies on predicting the load on the servers, which may not always be accurate. Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on Memory utilization is also not the most efficient solution as it does not address the issue of having enough instances available before office hours begin. Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on CPU utilization is not the most efficient solution either, as it may lead to over-provisioning of instances during non-peak hours and underutilization of instances during peak hours.
Therefore, option (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy to launch new instances before the start of the day is the MOST operationally efficient solution.
