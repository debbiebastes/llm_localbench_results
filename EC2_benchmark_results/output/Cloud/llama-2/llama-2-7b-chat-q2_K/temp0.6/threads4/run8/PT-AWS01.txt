A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The Security Engineer should choose option (B) to implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This will ensure that the sensitive PII data is encrypted at the client level before it is uploaded to AWS, and the master keys are securely managed by the Key Management Service (KMS).
Option (A) would not provide adequate security as the master key would be stored on the client-side, which could lead to unauthorized access or disclosure of the data. Option (C) is also not recommended as it would require the company to manage its own encryption keys, which may be challenging to maintain and secure. Option (D) is not a viable option as it would require the company to provide its own encryption key, which could lead to security breaches if not properly managed.
