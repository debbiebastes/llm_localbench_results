A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
AWS Config can automatically detect whether there are any security groups that allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using a AWS Config rule. The rule would check for any security groups that have inbound rules allowing TCP or UDP traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range and update them with the corporate firewall IP address associated with the security group. This ensures that only authorized sources can access the instance, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data.
Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances, which may not be feasible for all organizations due to cost and complexity reasons. Option (C) blocks source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, but this does not address the issue of unauthorized access to sensitive data. Option (D) uses AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but this may not be able to automatically remediate the security risk in real-time.
Therefore, option (A) is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk.
