A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 

The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B): The endpoint request timed-out.

When making API calls, it's essential to ensure that requests are processed within a reasonable time frame to avoid errors like this one. A 502 Bad Gateway error typically means that the server took too long to process the request or returned a timeout error. In this case, the Lambda function may have taken longer than expected to execute or return the result, causing the API Gateway proxy to timeout and return a 502 status code.
Other possible causes of this issue could include heavy loads on the server or network issues, but given the timing-out error message, it's likely that the Lambda function took longer than expected to execute.
