The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
This solution is the most suitable because it provides a centralized and automated way of deploying OS patches across multiple EC2 instances, ensuring that all instances are updated simultaneously. By integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, the team can also easily track and record any configuration changes, making auditing and compliance reporting much simpler.
Option (B) is not the best choice because it does not provide a centralized and automated way of deploying patches across multiple instances. Instead, it requires manual intervention to apply patches to each instance, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.
Option (C) is also not the best choice as it does not provide any centralized management capabilities for patch deployment across multiple instances. While AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager can deploy patches, it does not offer a centralized and automated way of doing so.
Finally, option (D) is not a feasible solution because automatic patch installation on a weekly basis may not be enough to address the immediate security risk identified by the IT Security team.
