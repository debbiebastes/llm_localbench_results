An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.

Rationale:

An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume provides persistent block storage for EC2 instances. It offers low latency and high throughput, making it suitable for mission-critical workloads. Amazon S3 is a scalable and durable object store that can store large amounts of data. By attaching an EBS volume in your EC2 instance, you can use Amazon S3 to store your backup data, and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. This will provide a cost-effective and durable storage solution for mission-critical workloads.
Option (A) is not the correct answer because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads, as they lack the performance and durability of EBS volumes. Option (C) is also not the correct answer because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a new feature that was introduced in 2019, and it may not be available in all regions. Therefore, option (B) is the best answer.
