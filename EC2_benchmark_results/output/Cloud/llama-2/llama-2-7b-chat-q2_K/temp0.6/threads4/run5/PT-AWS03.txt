A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Explanation:
The best answer is option (A), as it provides the most efficient solution for automatically remediating this security risk. Using AWS Config rules, you can detect whether there are any security groups that allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Once the detection is made, you can associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Option (B) involves setting up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances, which may be time-consuming and complex, especially if you have multiple EC2 instances and a large network infrastructure.
Option (C) involves blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACLs, which may not address the root cause of the security risk. It may also create additional complexity in managing access control lists across multiple subnets and networks.
Option (D) involves using AWS Shield to monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. While this option can help detect potential security risks, it may not provide an efficient solution for automating remediation of security groups, especially if you have a large number of security groups to manage.
