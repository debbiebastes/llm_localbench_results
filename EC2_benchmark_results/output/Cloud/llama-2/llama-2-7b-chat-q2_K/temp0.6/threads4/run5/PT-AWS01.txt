A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Rationale:
In this scenario, the web application should not send the unencrypted patient data to AWS, as it is sensitive and violates compliance regulations. Therefore, implementing client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key is the best option. This way, the encryption key is managed by the company's Key Management Service (KMS), ensuring that only authorized personnel can access and manage the keys securely.
Client-side encryption involves encrypting data on the application layer before it is sent to AWS, rather than in transit or at rest. This adds an additional layer of security to protect the sensitive patient data from unauthorized access. By managing the encryption key through KMS, the company can maintain control over its encryption keys and ensure they are securely stored and managed.
Option (A) is not a viable choice as it would involve sending the unencrypted data to AWS, which is prohibited by compliance regulations. Option (C) is also not recommended as it involves storing the encryption key with the customer, which could lead to security breaches if the key is compromised or stolen. Option (D) is also not a viable choice as it would require the company to provide its own encryption keys to AWS, which goes against compliance regulations.
