A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements is option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
EventBridge provides a centralized event management platform for AWS services, including DynamoDB. By creating an EventBridge rule, you can configure it to trigger a Lambda function whenever there are changes made to items in DynamoDB. This way, whenever there are updates made to items in the primary table, the changes will be automatically synced to the secondary table in another region through the Lambda function.
Option (A), Setting up DynamoDB Accelerator, is not ideal because it is a separate service that requires additional configuration and maintenance compared to using EventBridge. Option (B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery, while useful for point-in-time recovery, is not the best approach for real-time data synchronization as it involves manual intervention and may introduce additional complexity. Option (D), Enabling DynamoDB Streams, while related to EventBridge, is also not the most ideal way to comply with the requirements as it does not provide a centralized event management platform like EventBridge.
