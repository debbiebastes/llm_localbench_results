Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation: When scaling up your application, it is important to consider the throughput and resource utilization of each shard. Increasing the number of open shards beyond what is necessary can lead to unnecessary costs and decreased performance. With six shards open, you will have a good balance between processing power and cost savings. You can also monitor your application's performance closely to determine if additional instances are needed or if you can safely reduce the number of instances.
