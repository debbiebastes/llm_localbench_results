An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
Reasoning: An EBS volume provides persistent block storage that can be used for mission-critical workloads. By attaching an EBS volume to your EC2 instance, you can ensure that your data is persistently stored and available even in the event of a failure.
Storing your backup data in Amazon S3 provides a scalable and durable storage solution. You can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA, which provides a cost-effective and durable storage solution for long-term archival storage.
Option (A) is not the best choice because instance store volumes are not designed for mission-critical workloads. They are intended for use in development and testing environments.
Option (B) is also not the best choice because EBS volumes do not provide the same level of durability as S3, and they may not be suitable for mission-critical workloads.
Option (D) is not a feasible solution because One Zone-IA is only available in select regions, and it may not be suitable for organizations with global operations.
