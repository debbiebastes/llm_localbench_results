A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
The best option for protecting the backend systems of the trading platform from traffic spikes is (B): Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
API Gateway can handle high traffic by setting up throttling limits that limit the number of requests that can be made within a certain time frame, reducing the load on the backend systems. Additionally, API Gateway has caching capabilities that allow it to cache frequently accessed data, reducing the need for repeated requests to the backend systems.
Option (A) is not the best choice as using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling would increase costs and complexity without providing a significant improvement in scalability or traffic handling capabilities.
Option (C) is also not the best choice as CloudFront can only act as a cache for static assets such as images, videos, and other small files. It cannot handle the heavy processing required for API requests.
Option (D) is not a feasible solution as moving a Lambda function to a VPC would not provide any significant improvements in traffic handling capabilities.
