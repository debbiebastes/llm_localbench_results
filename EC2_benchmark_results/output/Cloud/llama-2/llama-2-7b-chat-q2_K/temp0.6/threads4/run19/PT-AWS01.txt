A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
Explanation: The security engineer should implement Amazon S3 client-side encryption to ensure that sensitive patient data remains secure and compliant with industry regulations. Using a KMS-managed customer master key will allow the company to control the encryption and decryption process, while ensuring that the unencrypted data is never sent to AWS. This approach provides an additional layer of security and compliance, as only authorized personnel will have access to the encryption keys. By implementing client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key, the company can meet its regulatory requirements while protecting sensitive patient information.
