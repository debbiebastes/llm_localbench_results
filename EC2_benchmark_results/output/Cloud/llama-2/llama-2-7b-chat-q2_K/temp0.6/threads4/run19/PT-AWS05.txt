A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements is (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach provides the following benefits:

1. Centralized management: With EventBridge, you can manage all your AWS services from a single platform.
2. Real-time monitoring: EventBridge provides real-time monitoring of your DynamoDB tables, allowing you to track changes made to the items in those tables.
3. Automated processing: By setting up a Lambda function as a rule target, you can automate the process of saving new changes to the other table. This eliminates the need for manual intervention and reduces the risk of human error.
4. Scalability: As your application grows, EventBridge can handle increased load without compromising performance.
5. Cost-effective: You only pay for the resources you use, making EventBridge a cost-effective solution for managing your DynamoDB tables.
In summary, creating an EventBride rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB and sets a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements.
