A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B) The endpoint request timed-out. When a developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error, it typically means that there was an issue with the server or the network connection that caused the request to time out. In the case of Amazon API Gateway, this could be due to the underlying Lambda function taking too long to execute, causing the request to timeout before the result can be returned.
Therefore, option (B) The endpoint request timed-out is the MOST likely root cause of this issue.
