The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the company’s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager provides an efficient and secure way to manage and automate the deployment of patches across various EC2 instances. By integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, the team can easily monitor and track any configuration changes, including the patch status, for all EC2 instances. This ensures that the company’s applications are safeguarded from security breaches and compliance issues.
Option (B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems is not the most suitable solution as it may cause delays in patch deployment due to the need to set up a separate service.
Option (C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances is also not the most suitable solution as it may not provide real-time monitoring and tracking of configuration changes.
Option (D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis is not the most suitable solution as this may lead to unintended consequences, such as patches being installed without proper testing and validation, which can cause security breaches or compliance issues.
