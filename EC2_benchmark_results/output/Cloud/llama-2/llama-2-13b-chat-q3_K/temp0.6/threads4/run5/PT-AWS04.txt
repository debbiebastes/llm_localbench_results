Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12

Explanation:

Since each KCL worker can process one shard, and you have six open shards after resharding, the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch is 6 (i.e., one instance per shard).

Therefore, option (B) 12 is the correct answer.
