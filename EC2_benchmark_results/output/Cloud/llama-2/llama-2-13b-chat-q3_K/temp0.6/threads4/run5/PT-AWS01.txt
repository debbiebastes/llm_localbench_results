A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Rationale: 
Since the application needs to store sensitive PII data, it is important that the data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Using a client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key ensures that neither the master keys nor the unencrypted data are sent to AWS, thereby complying with the company's regulatory requirements. Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key is more secure than other options because it uses a hardware security module (HSM) to protect the encryption keys and provides an additional layer of security against unauthorized access. Therefore, option (B) is the best choice for this scenario.
