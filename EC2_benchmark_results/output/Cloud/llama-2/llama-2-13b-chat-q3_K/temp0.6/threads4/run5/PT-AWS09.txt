A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

A is correct answer.

Rationale:

As the traffic spikes are expected, it's important to ensure that the backend systems can handle the increased load without any performance issues or downtime. AWS Lambda and API Gateway provide a scalable and highly available architecture, but they may not be able to handle sudden traffic spikes on their own.

Option A is the best choice because it suggests switching from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling. This would provide a more reliable and scalable solution for handling the increased traffic.

Option B would not be effective in this scenario as throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway are meant to handle normal traffic patterns, not sudden spikes.

Option C would also not be effective as CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that caches content, but it would not provide any additional scalability or availability for the backend systems.

Option D would not have any impact on the scenario as moving the Lambda function in a VPC would only provide a more secure environment for the function, but it would not address the issue of handling traffic spikes.
