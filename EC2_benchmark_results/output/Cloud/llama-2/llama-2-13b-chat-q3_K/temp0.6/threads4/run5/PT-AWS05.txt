A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) is an event bus service that enables you to subscribe to events from multiple AWS services, including DynamoDB. With EventBridge, you can create rules to filter and forward events to a target, such as a Lambda function. This approach allows you to record changes made to items in DynamoDB without the need for DynamoDB Accelerator or Point-in-Time Recovery. Additionally, this solution is more scalable and cost-effective compared to using DynamoDB Streams. Therefore, option C is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements.
