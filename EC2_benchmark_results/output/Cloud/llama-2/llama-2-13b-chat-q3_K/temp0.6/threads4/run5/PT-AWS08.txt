An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B

Explanation: 

Option B is the best choice for meeting the requirements. The EBS volume provides persistent storage that can be used for mission-critical workloads, and it will store the backup data in Amazon S3 using a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. This solution meets all the requirements of having a persistent block storage volume, storing backup data in S3, and archiving data in S3 Glacier.

Option A is not suitable because instance store volumes are temporary storage that will be lost when the EC2 instance is terminated or stopped. Option C is also not suitable because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not designed for long-term storage of data.

Option D is incorrect because the backup data will be stored in Amazon S3, but there is no need to attach an instance store volume to store the data.
