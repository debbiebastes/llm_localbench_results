A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation: A 502 Bad Gateway error is often seen when there's an issue with the server that's acting as the gateway, such as an incompatible output returned from the Lambda function that acts as a backend. This error message indicates that the response from the server is not in a correct format or cannot be processed by the client. As the developer was able to properly return the result in XML format when invoking the underlying function, it's likely that the issue is with the output format being returned by the Lambda function and not the request itself. Therefore, option (A) is the most likely root cause of this issue.
