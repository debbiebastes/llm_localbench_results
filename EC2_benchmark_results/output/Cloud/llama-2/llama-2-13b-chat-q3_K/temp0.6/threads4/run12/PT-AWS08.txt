An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

Correct answer is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:
To meet the requirement of persistent block storage, you should use an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume, which provides persistent storage that is not deleted when the instance is terminated or rebooted.

Option B is the correct answer as it suggests attaching an EBS volume to your EC2 instance and storing your backup data in Amazon S3 using a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. This approach provides persistent storage for your backup data, while also leveraging the scalability and durability of Amazon S3 for long-term storage.

Option A is incorrect because instance store volumes are not persistent and will be deleted when the instance is terminated or rebooted. Option C is incorrect because one zone-IA is not a service offered by AWS. Option D is incorrect because it does not provide a solution for storing backup data in Amazon S3.
