Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

The correct answer is (B) 12.

Rationale:

When you increase the number of open shards, you need more KCL workers to process the increased volume of data. Each EC2 instance can run one KCL worker, so you would need at least 6 instances to handle 6 shards. However, it's better to have some extra instances to handle any unexpected spikes in data and also for maintenance and scaling purposes.

12 instances is the maximum number that provides enough resources to handle the increased volume of data while also allowing for some extra capacity and redundancy.
