The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:

Option C is the most suitable solution in this scenario as it allows the IT Security team to quickly and easily deploy OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, which is a fully managed service that simplifies software updates and security patching across the organization. Additionally, option C suggests setting up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes, which provides detailed compliance statuses and enables auditing of all changes made to the EC2 instances. This combination of AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager and AWS Config ensures that all vulnerabilities are mitigated and documented for audit purposes.

Options A, B, and D do not address the security risk and compliance requirements as effectively as option C. Option A does not provide a comprehensive solution for patching EC2 instances and may require manual intervention to record and track changes. Option B is not a suitable solution as it does not address the compliance aspect of the requirement. Option D does not address the security risk immediately but rather postpones it to a later date, which may not be feasible in this scenario where the vulnerability needs immediate mitigation.
