A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Rationale:
API Gateway can help you control traffic spikes by enabling throttling limits and result caching. Throttling limits let you set a maximum number of requests that the API can handle per second, which helps prevent the backend from being overwhelmed with too many requests. Result caching allows API Gateway to cache responses to frequently asked questions, reducing the load on the backend.

Option (A) would not be effective in this scenario because it would require significant changes to the platform's architecture, and implementing EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling would take more time and effort to set up. Option (C) would also not work as CloudFront does not provide caching capabilities. Option (D) is a security measure and not directly related to traffic management.
