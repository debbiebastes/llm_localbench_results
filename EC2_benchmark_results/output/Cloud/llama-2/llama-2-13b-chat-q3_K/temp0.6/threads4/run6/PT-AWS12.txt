A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.	

Explanation:

The No Upfront, Convertible Reserved Instance pricing option (B) offers the lowest cost over a 3-year period. This option allows you to pay for the instances as you use them without any upfront costs. After three years, you can convert the reservation into a Standard Reserved Instance if your usage patterns change or if you want to take advantage of a better pricing option.

Option (A) offers all upfront pricing for a 1-year term, which is more expensive than Option (B) in the short term but provides more predictability and stability in pricing over the long term.

Option (C) is the most expensive option, offering all upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option provides the highest level of upfront predictability and stability, but it also locks you into a fixed price for the entire duration, which may not be the best choice if your usage patterns change over time.

Option (D) offers No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year. This option provides flexibility and low upfront costs but also requires annual renewals, which can result in higher long-term costs if the usage patterns remain consistent.
