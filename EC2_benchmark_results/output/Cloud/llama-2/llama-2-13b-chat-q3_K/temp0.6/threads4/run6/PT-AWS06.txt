A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation: When a 502 Bad Gateway error occurs, it usually means that the server acting as a gateway received an invalid response from an upstream server. In this case, the developer mentioned that the Lambda function properly returned the result in XML format, indicating that the output is not incompatible. Therefore, the root cause of the issue is likely due to an incompatible output returned from the Lambda proxy integration backend, which is option (A).
