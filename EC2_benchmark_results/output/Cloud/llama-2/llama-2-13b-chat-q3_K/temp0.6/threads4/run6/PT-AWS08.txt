An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

To meet the requirement of persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, option B is the best choice. EBS (Elastic Block Store) volumes are designed to provide persistent storage for EC2 instances and can be used for both operational and backup data.

Option A would not meet the requirement because instance store volumes are temporary storage that is deleted when the EC2 instance is terminated.

Option C would not meet the requirement because One Zone-IA is a storage class that provides infrequently accessed data in a single Availability Zone, and it may not be suitable for mission-critical workloads that require high availability and durability.

Lifecycle policies can be used to transition backup data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which is the required storage class for long-term backup data.

Therefore, option B is the best choice to meet the requirements of persistent block storage volume with long-term backup data stored in Amazon S3 Glacier.
