Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12

Explanation:

When resharding a Kinesis stream, the number of open shards should be at least twice the number of instances. The maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched is six, as per the question statement. Therefore, the optimum performance can be achieved by launching 12 instances, as there will be six instances for each of the two shards.
