The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

The best solution is (C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Rationale:

Option A is not suitable as it does not provide a centralized way to manage patches for multiple instances, and Amazon QuickSight is not designed for compliance tracking.

Option B is not the best solution as Patch Manager only supports patching for EC2 instances running AWS-provided OSes, which are not affected by the vulnerability in question.

Option D is not suitable as it does not address the immediate security risk and would require ongoing maintenance to ensure compliance.

Option C is the best solution as it allows for easy deployment of patches using Patch Manager, and provides a centralized way to record and track configuration changes using AWS Config.
