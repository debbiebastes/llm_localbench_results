Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 

(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).

EventBridge is a fully managed service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a centralized platform for managing events across AWS services, allowing you to trigger actions based on specific events and automate your application workflows.

Amazon SQS (A) is a message queue service that enables you to send and receive messages between independent software components. Amazon SNS (C) is a fully managed messaging service that sends push notifications or messages to multiple subscribers or clients. Amazon Kinesis (D) is a fully managed service that makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data such as video, audio, application logs, IoT telemetry, and other data streams.

While these services can be used in event-driven applications, they do not provide the same level of centralized event management as EventBridge.
