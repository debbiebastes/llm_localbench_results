An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

Correct answer is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

To meet the requirement of a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, option B is the best choice. Attaching an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume to an EC2 instance provides a highly available and scalable storage solution that can be used for both primary and secondary data storage needs.

Option A is not suitable because instance store volumes are optimized for temporary storage and are not intended for long-term use. Option C is not suitable because One Zone-IA is a feature of Amazon S3 that provides infrequent access to data, which may not be suitable for backup data that needs to be stored for 30 days.

Option B is the best choice because it allows you to attach an EBS volume to your EC2 instance and use Amazon S3 to store your backup data. You can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which will provide long-term storage at a lower cost.
