A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key."

Here is the explanation for the answer:

The correct option is (B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

This option ensures that the sensitive PII data remains encrypted even when it's stored in the S3 bucket, and only the authorized users can access the data by using their AWS credentials. The client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key will ensure that the encryption is done on the client-side before the data is sent to AWS, which means that the data remains encrypted even when it's stored in S3 and being transferred between the client and AWS.

Option (A) would not work because it would require the sensitive PII data to be sent to AWS unencrypted, which violates the requirement of never sending the master keys or the unencrypted data to AWS. Option (C) is not applicable since server-side encryption does not provide client-side encryption, and option (D) is not applicable since customer-provided keys are not recommended for sensitive data.

Therefore, the best option is to use a KMS-managed customer master key for client-side encryption of the sensitive PII data before it's sent to AWS.
