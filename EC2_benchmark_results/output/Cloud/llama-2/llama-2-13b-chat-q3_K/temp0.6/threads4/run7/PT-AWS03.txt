A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Correct answer: (A)

Explanation:

The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is to use AWS Config rules to detect and update the security groups that allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. By using Systems Manager Automation documents associated with an AWS Lambda function, the security group can be updated with the corporate firewall IP address, allowing only authorized traffic to flow through the firewall. This approach is efficient because it automates the remediation process and ensures that all affected security groups are updated consistently.

Option (B) setting up a Transit VPC is not relevant in this scenario, as it would not automatically detect or update the security groups. Option (C) blocking source IP addresses using Network ACLs may not be practical, as it would require manual configuration and maintenance. Option (D) using AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups that allow traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is not a feasible solution, as it does not provide automated remediation capabilities.
