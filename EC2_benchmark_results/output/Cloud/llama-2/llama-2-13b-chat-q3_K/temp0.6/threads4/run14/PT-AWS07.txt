A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

Correct answer is (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.

Rationale: The issue of slow performance during the start of the day is likely due to the sudden increase in user traffic, which causes memory usage to spike. By configuring a dynamic scaling policy that launches new instances based on memory utilization, the application can handle the increased traffic and maintain optimal performance during the busy period. The other options do not address the specific issue of memory usage and would not provide the same level of optimization.

Note: This is a fictional scenario and does not reflect any real-world situation, but it serves as an example to illustrate the concept of dynamic scaling and its potential benefits in addressing performance issues.
