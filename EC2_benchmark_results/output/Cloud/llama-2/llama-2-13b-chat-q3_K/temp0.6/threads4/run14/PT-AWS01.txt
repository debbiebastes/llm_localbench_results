A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Rationale: 

Option (A) is not feasible as it requires the sensitive data to be stored in plaintext on the client-side, which is not secure. Option (C) is also not feasible as it requires the storage of sensitive data in cleartext on the S3 server, which is not compliant with regulatory requirements. 

Option (D) is incorrect because customer provided keys are not secure and cannot be managed properly by AWS Key Management Service. 

Therefore, option (B) is the best solution, as KMS-managed customer master keys provide secure and compliant encryption of sensitive data in S3 buckets without having to store or manage the master key on the client side or server side.
