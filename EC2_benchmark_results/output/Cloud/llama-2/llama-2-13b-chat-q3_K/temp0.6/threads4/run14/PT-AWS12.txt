A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Rationale:

The cost-effective option would be (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option offers the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO) as there is no upfront fee, and the reserved instance can be used for three years without any additional costs.

Option (A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term has an upfront fee and higher hourly costs compared to option (B).

Option (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term also has an upfront fee and higher hourly costs compared to option (B).

Option (D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year has higher hourly costs compared to option (B), and the renewal fees would add up over time.

Therefore, based on the given scenario, option (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term is the most cost-effective choice for the company's needs.
