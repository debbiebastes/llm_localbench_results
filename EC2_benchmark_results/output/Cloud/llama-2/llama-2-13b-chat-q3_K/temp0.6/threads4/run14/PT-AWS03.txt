A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Rationale: This approach is the most efficient way to automatically detect and remediate the security risk because it uses AWS Config rules to monitor for unapproved security groups, and Systems Manager Automation documents to automatically update the security groups with the corporate firewall IP address. This solution does not require any additional infrastructure setup or third-party integrations, making it the most efficient option.

Explanation:

* Option (A) uses AWS Config rules to monitor for unapproved security groups and automates the remediation process using Systems Manager Automation documents. This approach is the most efficient way to automatically detect and remediate the security risk because it leverages AWS native services.
* Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances, but this solution does not address the security risk of unapproved security groups.
* Option (C) blocks source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, but this approach does not address the issue of unapproved security groups and may cause unnecessary blocking of legitimate traffic.
* Option (D) uses AWS Shield to monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but this approach does not provide a way to automatically remediate the security risk.
