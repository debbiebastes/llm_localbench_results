A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B. No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:

The option with the lowest cost would be (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option offers the best value since there is no upfront fee, and the instance can be converted to an On-Demand instance at any time without penalty. Additionally, the reserved instance can be used for more than three years without worrying about renewal fees or penalties.

The other options are not as cost-effective:

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term has an upfront fee and would be more expensive than option (B) in the long run, even though it offers a lower hourly rate.

(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term also has an upfront fee and does not offer as much flexibility as option (B), which can be converted to On-Demand at any time.

(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year would require more frequent payments and would not provide the same level of cost savings as option (B).
