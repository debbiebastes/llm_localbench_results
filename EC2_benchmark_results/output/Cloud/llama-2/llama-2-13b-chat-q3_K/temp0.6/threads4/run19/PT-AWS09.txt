A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:
API Gateway has features like throttling, caching, and load balancing that can help protect backend systems from traffic spikes. By enabling throttling limits and result caching, the platform can limit the number of requests that are sent to the backend at a time, reducing the load on the system and preventing overloading. Additionally, caching can reduce the number of requests made to the backend by storing frequently requested data in memory, which can help improve performance and reduce the load on the system.

Option (A) is not the best choice because EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling are not well-suited for handling sudden traffic spikes. They are more geared towards providing a stable and scalable architecture for the platform over time.

Option (C) is not relevant to this scenario since CloudFront is a content delivery network that caches content at edge locations, rather than caching API responses.

Option (D) is not related to protecting backend systems from traffic spikes.
