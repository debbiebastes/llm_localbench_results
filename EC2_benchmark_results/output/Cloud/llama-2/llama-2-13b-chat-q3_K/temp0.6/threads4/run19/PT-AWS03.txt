A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Correct answer: A

Explanation:

Option A is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk. By using AWS Config rules, you can detect any security groups that allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range and then associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is efficient because it automatically detects and remediates any security groups that are not following the company's security policies, without requiring manual intervention or additional infrastructure setup (such as a Transit VPC or Network ACL).

Option B is not relevant to the scenario, as Transit VPCs are used for connecting multiple VPCs, not for securing traffic between EC2 instances and a corporate firewall.

Option C would block all traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, regardless of whether it is required or not, which could have unintended consequences and affect legitimate traffic.

Option D is not relevant to the scenario, as AWS Shield is a security service that provides DDoS protection and threat monitoring, but it does not provide automatic remediation of security groups.
