An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes are block-level storage devices that can persistently store data even after the instance is terminated or rebooted. Therefore, option (B) is the best choice because it allows you to attach an EBS volume in your existing EC2 instance and use Amazon S3 as a backup storage solution.

Option (A) would not work because instance store volumes are only available on new instances launched from the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI, and cannot be attached to existing instances. Option (C) is also not correct because One Zone-IA is a more expensive option than Glacier for long-term storage needs. Therefore, it is not worth mentioning in this context.

Finally, option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not designed for long-term storage and cannot be used for mission-critical workloads.
