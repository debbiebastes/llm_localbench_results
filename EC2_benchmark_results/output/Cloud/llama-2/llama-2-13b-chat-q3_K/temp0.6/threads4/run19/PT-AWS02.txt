The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:

In this scenario, it is essential to prioritize security and compliance. The best solution would be to use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to quickly deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. This feature allows you to automatically apply software updates on a scheduled basis or as needed.

Additionally, setting up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes provides an audit trail of the entire process, which is essential for compliance purposes. It ensures that all changes are correctly documented, and their impact on the environment can be easily assessed. This integration helps maintain visibility into the state of the instances and enables quick detection of any deviations from the desired configurations.

Option (A) does not provide a comprehensive solution as it only focuses on AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager for patch deployment and does not address compliance reporting.

Option (B) is incorrect because AWS ES is a search and analytics service and has no direct relationship with configuration management or compliance reporting.

Option (D) is not an appropriate solution because it does not provide a comprehensive approach to security patching and compliance reporting.
