Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12

Explanation:

The KCL worker on each EC2 instance can process one shard at a time. Since you have six open shards, you should launch at least six EC2 instances to process all the shards optimally. Launching 12 instances will ensure that all the shards are processed in parallel, resulting in better performance.

Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer.
