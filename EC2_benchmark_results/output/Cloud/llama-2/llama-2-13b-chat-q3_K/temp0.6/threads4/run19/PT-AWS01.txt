A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Rationale:
To ensure that the sensitive PII data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, the security engineer should implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. The KMS-managed customer master key will be managed by AWS Key Management Service (KMS), which ensures that the key is securely generated, stored, and used to encrypt data in S3. Additionally, using a KMS-managed key avoids the need for the security engineer to manage the client-side encryption keys, which can reduce the risk of keys being leaked or compromised. Therefore, option (B) is the best choice.
