A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Rationale: The correct answer is (B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This option meets the requirements of never sending the master keys to AWS, as the master key is managed by the company's KMS and not stored or transmitted to AWS. Additionally, this approach ensures that the sensitive PII data is encrypted on the client-side before it is uploaded to S3, which provides an additional layer of security.

Explanation: 

* (A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key: This option would require the master key to be stored and transmitted to AWS, which violates the requirement of never sending the master keys to AWS.
* (C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key: This option would not meet the requirements as the master key is still stored and managed by AWS, and not by the company's KMS.
* (D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key: This option is not secure as it allows the customer to provide their own key, which may not be secure or properly managed.
