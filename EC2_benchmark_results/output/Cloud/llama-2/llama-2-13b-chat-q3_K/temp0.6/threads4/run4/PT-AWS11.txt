Description:
Amazon EventBridge (previously known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It allows you to integrate AWS services and custom applications using events, providing a way to communicate between them without having to worry about the complexity of point-to-point communication.
