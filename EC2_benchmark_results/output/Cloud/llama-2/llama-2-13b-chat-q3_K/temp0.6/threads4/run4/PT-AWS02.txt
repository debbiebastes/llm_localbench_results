The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

Please select...
C - Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Correct answer: C

Rationale:

Option A is not suitable because it requires additional tools, such as Amazon QuickSight and Kibana, which are not necessary for this scenario.

Option B is not suitable because it does not provide a centralized solution for patch management and configuration tracking.

Option D is not suitable because it does not address the need to record and track any configuration changes for audit purposes.

Option C is the most suitable solution as it provides a centralized solution for patch management and configuration tracking through AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, and also records and tracks any configuration changes using AWS Config.
