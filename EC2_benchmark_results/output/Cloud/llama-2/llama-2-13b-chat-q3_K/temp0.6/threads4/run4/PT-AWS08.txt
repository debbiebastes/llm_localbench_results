An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:
To meet the requirement of a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, option (B) is the best choice. EBS volumes are optimized for persistently storing data and provide the performance and durability required for mission-critical workloads. Option (A) would not be suitable because instance store volumes are designed for temporary storage and are not suitable for long-term persistence.

Option (C) is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is an infrequently accessed storage class, which may not provide the same level of durability as Glacier. Option (D) is also incorrect because instance store volumes are not designed for long-term persistence and would not be suitable for storing backup data.

By using an EBS volume and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier, you can ensure that your backup data is stored persistently and that the data is transitioned to long-term storage after 30 days. This approach meets all of the requirements stated in the question.
