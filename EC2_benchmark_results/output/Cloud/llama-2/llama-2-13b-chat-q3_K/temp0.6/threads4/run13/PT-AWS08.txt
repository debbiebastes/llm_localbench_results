An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

The given requirement is looking for a persistent block storage volume that can be used for mission-critical workloads, and the backup data needs to be stored in an object storage service after 30 days. Therefore, option (A) is the best choice as it suggests attaching an instance store volume in the existing EC2 instance, which provides persistent block storage.

Option (B) suggests using EBS volumes, which are not suitable for mission-critical workloads. Option (C) and (D) suggest using Amazon S3, which is an object storage service, but does not provide the required persistent block storage.

Therefore, option (A) is the best choice to meet the given requirement.
