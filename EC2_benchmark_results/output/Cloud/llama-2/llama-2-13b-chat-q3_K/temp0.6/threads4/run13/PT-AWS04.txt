Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

Correct answer is: (C) 3

Explanation:

Since each KCL worker can handle one shard, and you have six shards in total, you should launch three EC2 instances to achieve optimum performance. Launching more instances than necessary will not improve performance but will increase your costs.
