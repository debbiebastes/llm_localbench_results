Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Explanation:

Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed event bus that allows you to communicate between different services and microservices in your application, providing loosely coupled architectures.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queue service that enables you to decouple the components of your application by sending messages between them. However, it doesn't provide event-driven architecture and doesn't support loose coupling.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a messaging service that sends notifications or messages to multiple subscribers. It doesn't provide event-driven architecture or loose coupling.

Amazon Kinesis is a streaming service that enables you to build real-time data processing applications. While it can be used for event-driven architecture, it doesn't provide the same level of flexibility and control as Amazon EventBridge.
