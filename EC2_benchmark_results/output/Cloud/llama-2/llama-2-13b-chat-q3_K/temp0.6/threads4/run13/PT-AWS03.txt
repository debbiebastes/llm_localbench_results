A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

Correct answer is A.

Rationale: The best way to automatically remediate this security risk is to use AWS Config rules to detect and update the security groups with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is more efficient than setting up a Transit VPC, blocking source IP addresses using Network ACLs, or using AWS Shield. By using AWS Config rules, you can automatically detect when a security group allows inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range and update the security group with the correct IP address. This approach is less complex and requires fewer resources than the other options."
