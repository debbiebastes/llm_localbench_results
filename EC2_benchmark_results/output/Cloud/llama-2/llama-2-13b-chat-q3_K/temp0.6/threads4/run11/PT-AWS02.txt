The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:

The most suitable solution in this scenario is option (C) as it addresses both security concerns and compliance requirements simultaneously. 

Using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, the team can easily deploy OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances, which will help mitigate the security risk associated with these vulnerabilities. Additionally, setting up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes provides an audit trail that demonstrates compliance with security policies and procedures.

Option (A) is not suitable as it only partially addresses the issue of recording configuration changes, and option (B) is not practical as it requires additional setup and maintenance. Option (D) is not relevant as automatic patch installation is not a suitable solution for this scenario.
