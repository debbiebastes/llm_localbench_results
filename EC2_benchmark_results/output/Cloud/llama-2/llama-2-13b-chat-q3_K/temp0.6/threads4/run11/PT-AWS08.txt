An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

The correct answer is option A. Attaching an instance store volume in the existing EC2 instance would provide a persistent block storage volume that can be used for mission-critical workloads. Using Amazon S3 to store backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days would meet the requirement of storing backup data in an object storage service.

Option B is incorrect because using EBS instead of instance store volume may not provide the required persistent block storage.

Option C is incorrect because One Zone-IA is a storage class for objects that are stored in a single availability zone, which may not meet the requirement of storing backup data in an object storage service.

Option D is incorrect because the backup data should be stored in Amazon S3 instead of instance store volume.
