A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:
When there is an expected increase in traffic, it's important to avoid overloading the backend systems. One way to do this is by enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway. Throttling limits can help regulate the number of requests that are sent to the backend, preventing overload and ensuring a smoother user experience. Result caching can also help reduce the load on the backend by storing frequently requested data in memory, reducing the need for multiple database queries or Lambda invocations.

Option A is not a good choice because EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling are not designed to handle short-term traffic spikes, and it would be costly and time-consuming to set up and configure these resources. Option C is also not a good choice because CloudFront does not provide the necessary functionality for throttling or caching. Option D is not relevant to this scenario as VPCs do not handle traffic spikes.
