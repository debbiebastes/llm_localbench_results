A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway."

This answer is correct because enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway can help protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes. Throttling limits can regulate the number of requests that are allowed to reach the Lambda function, preventing overload and potential crashes. Result caching can also help reduce the load on the Lambda function by storing frequently requested data in memory, allowing it to handle more concurrent requests without overloading.

Option A is incorrect because switching to a more scalable architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling would not address the issue of traffic spikes immediately. It would take some time to set up and deploy these resources, and they may not be able to handle sudden traffic surges as effectively as caching and throttling.

Option C is incorrect because CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that can cache static assets, but it cannot cache the results of Lambda functions. Therefore, using CloudFront in front of API Gateway would not provide any benefit in this scenario.

Option D is incorrect because moving the Lambda function to a VPC would not address the issue of traffic spikes. It may improve security, but it would not help handle sudden traffic surges.
