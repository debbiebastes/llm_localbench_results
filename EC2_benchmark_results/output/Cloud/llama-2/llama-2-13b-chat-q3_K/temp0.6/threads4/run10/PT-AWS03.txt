A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:
The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is to use AWS Config rules to detect any security groups that allow inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. This can be done by creating an AWS Config rule that checks for the existence of security groups with inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and then associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is efficient because it leverages AWS Config's ability to automatically detect and remediate security risks, and it also uses Systems Manager Automation to simplify the process of updating the security groups.

The other options do not fully address the security risk:

(B) Setting up a Transit VPC would not directly address the security risk of inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

(C) Blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACLs would block all traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which may not be desirable if there are legitimate sources that need to access the EC2 instances.

(D) Using AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range would not provide a direct solution for remediating the risk.
