Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 

(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Explanation:

Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed event bus that allows you to communicate between microservices, handle events, and trigger downstream processes.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service), Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service), and Amazon Kinesis are not directly related to building event-driven applications or decoupling components of an application architecture. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).
