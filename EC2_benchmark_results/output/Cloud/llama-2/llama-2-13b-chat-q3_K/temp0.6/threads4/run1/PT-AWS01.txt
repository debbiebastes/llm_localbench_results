A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:

In this scenario, the hospital wants to ensure that their sensitive patient data is securely stored in AWS without ever sending the master keys or unencrypted data to AWS. To achieve this, the Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption using a KMS-managed customer master key.

Client-side encryption is performed on the client-side (i.e., within the hospital's application) before data is sent to S3. This ensures that the data remains encrypted even when it is stored in S3, and the master keys are never exposed to AWS. By using a KMS-managed customer master key, the hospital can maintain control over their encryption keys, which are rotated regularly to ensure ongoing security.

Option (A) is incorrect because it would require the hospital to manage their own client-side encryption, which could be error-prone and difficult to maintain. Option (C) is also incorrect because S3 server-side encryption does not provide the same level of control over encryption keys as client-side encryption. Option (D) is not a valid choice as customer-provided keys are not supported for S3.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (B), which provides the desired level of security and compliance with regulatory requirements, while also ensuring that the hospital maintains control over their encryption keys.
