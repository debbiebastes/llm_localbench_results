The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

The best solution in this scenario is option C, Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:

AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides a centralized way to manage patches for EC2 instances with outdated operating systems. It allows you to automatically apply patches, monitor progress, and verify the success of patch deployment. By using Patch Manager, the IT Security team can quickly remediate the security risk associated with the vulnerability.

Additionally, setting up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes provides an audit trail for compliance purposes. This allows the IT Security team to demonstrate that they have taken appropriate action to mitigate the security risk and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.
