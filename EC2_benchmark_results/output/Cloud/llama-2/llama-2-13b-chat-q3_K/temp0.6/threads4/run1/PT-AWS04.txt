Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12

Explanation:

When resharding a Kinesis stream, the number of open shards is increased to six. Each instance can process one shard, so the maximum number of EC2 instances that should be launched to achieve optimum performance is 6 (the total number of open shards). Therefore, option (B) 12 is the correct answer.
