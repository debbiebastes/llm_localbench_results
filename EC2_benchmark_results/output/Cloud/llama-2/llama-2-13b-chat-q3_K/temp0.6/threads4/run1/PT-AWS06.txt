A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Rationale: The error message "502 Bad Gateway" indicates that the response from the upstream server (in this case, the Lambda function) is not in the expected format or contains invalid content. Since the developer mentioned that the underlying function properly returned the result in XML format, it suggests that the issue is with the output format of the Lambda function, which is not compatible with the Amazon API Gateway proxy integration.
