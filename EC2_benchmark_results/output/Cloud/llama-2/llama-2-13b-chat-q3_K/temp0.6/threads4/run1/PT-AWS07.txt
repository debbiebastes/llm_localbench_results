A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day."

Explanation:

The best solution to ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day is to configure a scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group. By launching new instances before the start of the day, the application will have more resources available to handle the increased traffic and usage during office hours.

Option A, predictive scaling, is not the best choice as it adjusts based on demand and may not be able to anticipate the increased usage at the beginning of the day.

Option B, dynamic scaling based on memory utilization, may not be the most effective approach as memory usage may not be the best indicator of performance during office hours.

Option D, dynamic scaling based on CPU utilization, is also not the best choice as it may not take into account the increased usage at the beginning of the day.

Scheduled scaling policies allow you to define a specific time frame when instances should be launched or terminated, which in this case will ensure that the application has enough resources available during office hours."
