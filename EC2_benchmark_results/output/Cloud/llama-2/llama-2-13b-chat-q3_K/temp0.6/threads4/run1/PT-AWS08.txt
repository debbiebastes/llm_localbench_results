An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Option (A) is not suitable because instance store volumes are not designed for long-term storage and cannot be used for mission-critical workloads.

Option (C) is also not suitable because one-zone-IA is a feature that allows you to store data in a single Availability Zone, which may not meet the requirement of storing backup data in a different availability zone.

Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not designed for long-term storage and cannot be used for mission-critical workloads.

Option (B) is the best option because EBS volumes are designed for long-term storage and can be used for mission-critical workloads. By using an EBS volume and Amazon S3, you can store your backup data in a persistent storage volume and transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days using a lifecycle policy. This meets the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads and storing backup data in an object storage service.
