An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Rationale:

Option A is not the best choice because instance store volumes are designed for temporary storage and are not suitable for long-term data storage. Option C is incorrect because One Zone-IA is not a storage class, it's a availability zone designation. Option D is incorrect because it does not address the requirement of storing the backup data in an object storage service.

Option B is the best choice because EBS volumes are designed for long-term storage and can be used to store large amounts of data. By using Amazon S3 to store the backup data, you can take advantage of its scalability and durability features. Additionally, configuring a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days will help you meet your requirement of storing the data in an object storage service.
