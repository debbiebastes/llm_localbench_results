A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Correct answer: A. Using AWS Config rules to detect and remediate security groups that allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk. This approach allows for automated detection and remediation of the security risk, without requiring manual intervention or changes to existing infrastructure.

Explanation:

Option A is the best answer because it provides a comprehensive solution that automatically detects and remediates the security risk. AWS Config rules can be used to monitor for security groups that allow inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function to update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach ensures that all instances with insecure security groups are updated with the correct firewall IP address, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to the network.

Option B is not a viable solution because it does not provide automatic detection and remediation of the security risk. Setting up a Transit VPC would require manual configuration and ongoing management, and would not provide the same level of automation as option A.

Option C is not a viable solution because it would block all traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which could have unintended consequences and impact legitimate traffic.

Option D is not a viable solution because it does not provide automatic detection and remediation of the security risk. AWS Shield can be used to monitor for security threats, but it would not provide the same level of automation as option A.
