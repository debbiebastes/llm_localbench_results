The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Rationale: The best solution would be to use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the OS patches to the outdated EC2 instances, as this would allow for efficient and automated patching of the vulnerability. Additionally, setting up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes would provide a comprehensive audit trail for compliance purposes. This solution is more suitable than other options because it provides a centralized and automated way to manage patches and track compliance across multiple EC2 instances, while also providing detailed reporting and alerting capabilities in case of any issues or deviations from the desired configuration.
