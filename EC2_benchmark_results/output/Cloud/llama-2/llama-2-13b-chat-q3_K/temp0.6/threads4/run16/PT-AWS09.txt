A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway."

Explanation:
When there is an increase in traffic, it is important to control the number of requests that reach the backend system so as not to overload it. The best solution in this scenario would be option B, which involves enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway. This would allow you to regulate the traffic coming into the platform and prevent the backend systems from being overwhelmed by excessive requests.

Option A would not be a good choice as it would require significant changes to the platform's architecture, which could introduce additional risks and downtime. Option C would also not be effective in this scenario since CloudFront is primarily used for content delivery and caching, rather than traffic regulation. Option D would have no impact on the platform's performance or security.

Therefore, option B is the best choice for protecting the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes."
