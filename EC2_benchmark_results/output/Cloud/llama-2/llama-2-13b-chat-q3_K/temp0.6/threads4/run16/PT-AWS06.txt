A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

The issue is likely caused by the incompatible output returned by the Lambda function, which is causing the API Gateway to return a 502 Bad Gateway error. The fact that the developer was able to properly invoke the underlying function and receive a result in XML format suggests that the problem is not with the function itself, but rather with the output it is returning. Therefore, option A is the most likely root cause of the issue.
