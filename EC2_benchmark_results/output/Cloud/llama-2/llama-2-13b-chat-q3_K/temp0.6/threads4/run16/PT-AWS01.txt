A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Rationale: The company should never send the master keys to AWS, so the only option that meets this requirement is (B), which uses a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach allows for secure and compliant storage of sensitive PII data in Amazon S3 while keeping the master keys securely on the client side.

Note: Options A, C, and D are not suitable as they involve storing the master keys or unencrypted data in AWS, which is not compliant with the company's regulatory requirements.
