Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Explanation:
Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed event bus that allows you to communicate between different services and applications, loosely coupled and with a high degree of scalability.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queuing service that enables you to decouple components of your application architecture, but it does not provide the same level of event-driven architecture as Amazon EventBridge.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a fully managed messaging service that sends messages or push notifications to multiple subscribers or clients, but it is not primarily designed for building event-driven applications.

Amazon Kinesis is a fully managed video and data streaming service that can be used for real-time data processing and event-driven architecture, but it is not the primary service for building event-driven applications.
