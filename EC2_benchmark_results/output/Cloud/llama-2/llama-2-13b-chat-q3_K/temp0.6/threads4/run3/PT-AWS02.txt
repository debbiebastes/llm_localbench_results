The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

Correct answer is (C). Using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances, and setting up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes would be the most suitable solution in this scenario. This approach ensures that all EC2 instances are updated with the latest security patches and provides a centralized platform for tracking compliance statuses. 

Rationale:

Option (A) does not provide centralized management of EC2 instances, and using Amazon QuickSight to record changes may not be feasible in this scenario due to the large number of instances involved. Option (B) also does not provide a centralized platform for tracking compliance statuses, and relies on an external database like Elasticsearch. Option (D) would not ensure that all instances are updated with the latest patches, as it only updates on a weekly basis.
