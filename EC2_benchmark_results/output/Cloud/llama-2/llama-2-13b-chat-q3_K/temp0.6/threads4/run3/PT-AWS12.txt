Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. 

Cost analysis:

Option A: All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term
Upfront cost = $120 (based on the example provided in the question)
Monthly cost = $8.33 ($120 / 15 months)
Total cost over 3 years = $399.95 ($120 + (3 x $8.33))

Option B: No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term
No upfront cost
Monthly cost = $6.54 ($120 / 18 months)
Total cost over 3 years = $239.95 ($6.54 x 36 months)

Option C: All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term
Upfront cost = $120 (based on the example provided in the question)
Monthly cost = $8.33 ($120 / 15 months)
Total cost over 3 years = $399.95 ($120 + (3 x $8.33))

Option D: No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.
No upfront cost
Monthly cost = $6.54 ($120 / 18 months)
