An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation: To meet the requirement for a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads, you should attach an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume in your EC2 instance. This will provide a highly available and scalable storage solution that can be used for both the operating system and the backup data.

Option A is not suitable because instance store volumes are not designed for long-term storage and may not be highly available. Option C is not suitable because One Zone-IA is a less expensive storage class that is not designed for mission-critical workloads.

To meet the requirement for storing backup data in an object storage service, you can use Amazon S3. You should configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days to reduce storage costs and improve long-term storage efficiency.
