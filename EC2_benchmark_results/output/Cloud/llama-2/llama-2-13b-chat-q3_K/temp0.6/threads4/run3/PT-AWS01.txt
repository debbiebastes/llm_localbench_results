A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Rationale: This solution will ensure that the data is encrypted on the client-side using a KMS-managed customer master key, which will never be sent to AWS. The KMS-managed customer master key will be stored securely within the hospital's premises, and only the encryption and decryption operations will be performed on the client-side, ensuring that sensitive PII data remains secure and compliant with the company's regulatory requirements.

This solution also provides additional benefits such as easier management of encryption keys, better performance, and scalability. Additionally, this approach ensures that the sensitive data is encrypted even when it is being transmitted over the internet to AWS, providing an additional layer of security.
