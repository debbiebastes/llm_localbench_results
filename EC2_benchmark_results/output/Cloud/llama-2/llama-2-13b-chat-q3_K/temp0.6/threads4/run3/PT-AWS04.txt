Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12

Explanation:

With six open shards, you can launch six KCL workers per instance to achieve optimal performance. Since each instance can only run one KCL worker, you will need at least six instances to process all the shards. Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch is 12.
