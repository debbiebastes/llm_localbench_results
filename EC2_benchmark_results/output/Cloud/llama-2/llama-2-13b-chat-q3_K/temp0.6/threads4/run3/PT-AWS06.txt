A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation: The error message "502 Bad Gateway" typically indicates that the server is acting as a gateway and is unable to fulfill the request because the server is down or not responding. In this case, since the developer can invoke the underlying function properly, it suggests that the issue is with the output from the Lambda function being incompatible with the API Gateway proxy integration. Therefore, option (A) is the most likely root cause of the problem.
