A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

Option A is not suitable because DynamoDB Accelerator is a feature that improves read performance for certain types of queries, but it doesn't help with recording changes.

Option B is not necessary because we already have a solution in place using EventBridge and Lambda.

Option D is also not necessary because EventBridge can trigger our Lambda function to process new changes without the need for DynamoDB Streams.

Therefore, option C is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements, as it uses the least amount of resources and provides a simple solution for recording changes in DynamoDB.
