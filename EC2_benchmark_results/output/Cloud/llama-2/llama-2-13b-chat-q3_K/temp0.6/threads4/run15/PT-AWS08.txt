An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Option (A) is not the correct answer because instance store volumes are not suitable for persistent storage and cannot be used for mission-critical workloads.

Option (C) is incorrect because One Zone-IA is a cold storage class, which is not suitable for active data that needs to be accessed frequently.

Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not suitable for persistent storage and cannot be used for mission-critical workloads.

The correct answer is option (B), which involves attaching an EBS volume to the EC2 instance, using Amazon S3 as the backup data store, and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition the objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. This meets the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume that can be used for mission-critical workloads and storing the backup data in an object storage service.
