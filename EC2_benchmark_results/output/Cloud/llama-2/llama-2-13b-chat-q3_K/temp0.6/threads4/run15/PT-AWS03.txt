A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Rationale: This approach is the most efficient way to automatically remediate the security risk because it leverages AWS Config rules to detect the security groups that allow traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and it uses Systems Manager Automation to update the security groups with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is automated and does not require manual intervention, making it more efficient than other options.

Option B is not a viable solution as Transit VPCs do not provide security features such as blocking traffic from specific IP ranges. Option C would only block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range and would not update the security groups with the corporate firewall IP address. Option D is not a viable solution as AWS Shield does not provide the capability to automatically remediate security risks.
