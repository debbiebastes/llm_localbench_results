A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.

Rationale: The application's performance issues at the start of the day are likely due to high memory usage, which suggests that adding more instances with higher memory capabilities would be the most effective solution. By configuring a dynamic scaling policy that launches new instances based on memory utilization, the number of instances with sufficient memory will increase during peak usage hours, ensuring better performance for the application at the start of the day.

Note: The other options are not optimal as they do not address the specific issue of high memory usage and may not provide the desired results.
