A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key."

Explanation: 
The best approach to securely store sensitive PII data in an Amazon S3 bucket is to use client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach ensures that the data remains encrypted even when it's stored on AWS, and the master key is never sent to AWS.

Option (A) would require the Security Engineer to manage the client-side encryption keys, which is not recommended as it increases the risk of key management errors and exposes the Security Engineer to the possibility of accidentally exposing the sensitive data.

Option (C) is server-side encryption, which means that AWS manages the encryption and decryption of the data, but this approach requires the master key to be stored on AWS, which contradicts the requirement of never sending the master key to AWS.

Option (D) is also server-side encryption, but with a customer-provided key. This approach is not recommended as it would require the Security Engineer to manage the encryption and decryption of the data outside of AWS, which could lead to security issues and compliance risks.
