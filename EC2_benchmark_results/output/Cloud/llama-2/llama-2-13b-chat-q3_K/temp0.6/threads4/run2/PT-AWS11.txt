Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Explanation:
Amazon EventBridge, formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events, is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a managed event bus that allows you to subscribe to events from multiple sources, such as other AWS services or custom applications, and route them to multiple targets, such as Lambda functions or other AWS services.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queue service that enables you to decouple the components of your application architecture, but it does not provide event-driven architecture capabilities like EventBridge. Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a messaging service that sends messages or push notifications to multiple subscribers, but it is not designed for decoupling application components. Amazon Kinesis is a streaming service that enables you to build real-time data processing applications, but it does not provide event-driven architecture capabilities like EventBridge.
