An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

Correct answer is option B.

Explanation:

Option A is incorrect because instance store volumes are not designed for long-term storage and are not suitable for mission-critical workloads.

Option C is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a storage class that is optimized for infrequently accessed data, but it does not provide the same level of durability and availability as Amazon S3 Glacier.

Option D is incorrect because instance store volumes are not designed for long-term storage and are not suitable for mission-critical workloads.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer, which suggests attaching an EBS volume in your EC2 instance, using Amazon S3 to store your backup data, and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. This approach provides a reliable and durable storage solution for your mission-critical workloads while also providing long-term storage for your backup data in Amazon S3 Glacier.
