A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Rationale:

In this scenario, the security engineer should use a KMS-managed customer master key to encrypt the data before it is sent to AWS. This approach ensures that the master keys are never sent to AWS and are kept secure on the hospital's premises, in compliance with their strict compliance and regulatory requirements. 

The KMS-managed customer master key will be used to encrypt the data both in transit and at rest, providing an additional layer of security and compliance. Client-side encryption is preferred as it ensures that the hospital's sensitive PII data is never exposed in plain text while in transit or at rest in AWS. Therefore, option B is the best choice for this scenario.
