A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.	

Rationale:	
The cost of using the On-Demand EC2 instance can be calculated as follows:

On-Demand EC2 instance pricing = $0.09 per hour x 24 hours per day x 365 days per year = $2,781 per year

The cost of using a Reserved Instance for 3 years can be calculated as follows:	

No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing = $0.07 per hour x 24 hours per day x 365 days per year x 3 years = $2,279 per year

Therefore, option B, No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term, is the most cost-effective option.
