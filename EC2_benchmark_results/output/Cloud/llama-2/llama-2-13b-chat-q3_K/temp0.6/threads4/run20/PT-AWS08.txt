An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B. Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

To meet the requirement of a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, you should choose option B, which involves attaching an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume to your EC2 instance. This will provide a highly available and scalable storage solution that can be used for both the operating system and the backup data.

Option A is not suitable because instance store volumes are not designed for long-term use and do not provide the same level of persistence as EBS volumes. Option C is also not suitable because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a storage class that provides infrequent access to data, which may not be appropriate for mission-critical workloads that require high availability and fast access times.

By using an EBS volume and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, you will have a cost-effective solution that provides the required persistence and scalability for your backup data. Additionally, Amazon S3 Glacier provides long-term archiving storage that is optimized for infrequently accessed data, which aligns with the requirement of storing the backup data for 30 days and then archiving it.
