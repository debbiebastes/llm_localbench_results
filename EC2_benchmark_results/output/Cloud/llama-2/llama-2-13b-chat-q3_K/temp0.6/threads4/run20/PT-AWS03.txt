A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address."

Explanation:

The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is to use AWS Config rules to detect and update the security groups. By using AWS Config, you can define a rule that checks for security groups allowing inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and then associates an Automation document with an AWS Lambda function to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is more efficient than setting up a Transit VPC (option B), blocking source IP addresses using Network ACLs (option C), or using AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups (option D).

Using AWS Config rules, you can define a rule that checks for security groups allowing inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range and automatically remediate the issue by updating the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is more efficient than manually reviewing and updating each security group, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.

Additionally, using Systems Manager Automation documents in conjunction with AWS Lambda functions allows for automated remediation, which can help reduce the risk of human error or intentional bypass of security controls.
