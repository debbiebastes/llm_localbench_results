A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Rationale: The best approach would be to optimize the existing infrastructure by enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway rather than switching to a more scalable architecture or using CloudFront as it will require significant changes in the current setup. Throttling limits will help control the traffic flow, preventing the backend systems from being overwhelmed while result caching will reduce the number of requests made to the Lambda function, minimizing the load on the backend systems.

Note: (A) is not a good option as it would require significant changes in the current setup and might not be as effective in addressing the issue as options B and C. (C) is not an optimal solution as CloudFront may introduce additional latency and increase costs.)
