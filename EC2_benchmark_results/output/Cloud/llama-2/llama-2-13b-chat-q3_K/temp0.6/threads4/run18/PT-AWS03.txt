A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
A

Explanation: 
The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is to use AWS Config rules to detect and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach allows for real-time monitoring and automatic remediation of any security groups that allow traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, ensuring compliance with the company's security policies.

Option B, setting up a Transit VPC, is not necessary in this case as it would require additional infrastructure setup and configuration, and would not provide real-time monitoring or automatic remediation capabilities.

Option C, blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, may not be effective in this case as the traffic is already allowed by the security groups.

Option D, using AWS Shield to monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, may not be efficient as it would require additional setup and configuration, and would not provide real-time monitoring or automatic remediation capabilities.
