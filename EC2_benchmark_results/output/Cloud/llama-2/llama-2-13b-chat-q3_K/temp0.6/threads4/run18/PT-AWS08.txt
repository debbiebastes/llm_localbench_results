An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

Amazon S3 is not appropriate for mission-critical workloads, so option B is incorrect. Option C is incorrect because it suggests using Amazon S3 One Zone-IA which does not support data archiving. Therefore, the best option is option A - Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance and use Amazon S3 to store your backup data.

Instead of a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier, you can configure a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Cold Storage after 30 days which is more cost-effective for long-term storage of infrequently accessed data and meets the requirement of storing backup data in an object storage service.

Note that instance store volumes are not suitable for long-term storage as they are intended for temporary storage of data and can be lost or corrupted if the instance is terminated or stopped. Therefore, it's important to use a persistent block storage volume like EBS for storing backup data.
