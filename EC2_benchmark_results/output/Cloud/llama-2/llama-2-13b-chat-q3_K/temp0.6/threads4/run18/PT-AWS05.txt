A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:
Option A is not ideal because it requires setting up an additional service (DynamoDB Accelerator) when the existing DynamoDB instance can be used for replication. Option B is also not ideal because it would require enabling Point-in-Time Recovery, which would result in additional storage and recovery time, and would not provide real-time updates to the other table.

Option C is the most ideal choice because it utilizes Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) to track table-level events in DynamoDB and set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach provides real-time updates to the other table, without requiring any additional infrastructure or maintenance.

Option D is not ideal because it would require enabling DynamoDB Streams, which would result in additional storage and processing time, and would not provide real-time updates to the other table.
