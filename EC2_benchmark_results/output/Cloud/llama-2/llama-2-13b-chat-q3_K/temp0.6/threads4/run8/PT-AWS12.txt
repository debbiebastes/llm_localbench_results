A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Rationale:

The No Upfront, Convertible Reserved Instance pricing option offers the lowest cost for long-term usage. The 3-year term provides the longest upfront commitment period with the lowest hourly rate, which is more cost-effective than other options in the long run, especially since the application will be used for more than 3 years.

The All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing option has a higher hourly rate compared to the No Upfront option and may not provide significant savings over the long term.

The All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing option is the most expensive option and is not recommended for long-term usage.

The No Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing option for a 1-year term that is renewed every year is not recommended as it does not provide any long-term cost savings and may result in higher overall costs over the 3-year period.
