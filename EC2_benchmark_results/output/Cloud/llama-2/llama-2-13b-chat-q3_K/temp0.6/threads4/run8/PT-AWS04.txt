Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(B) 12

Explanation:
To scale up processing in your application, resharding the stream to increase the number of open shards from four to six will distribute the data load across more instances. Each instance can handle a maximum of six shards. Therefore, you should launch 12 EC2 instances for optimum performance since each instance can handle six shards.

Note: The actual number of instances needed may vary based on the specific requirements and workload of your application. This is just a general guideline to help you get started with scaling up your application.
