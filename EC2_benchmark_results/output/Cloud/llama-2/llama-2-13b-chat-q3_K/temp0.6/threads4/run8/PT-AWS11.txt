Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 

(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Explanation:

Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed event bus that allows you to communicate between microservices, trigger workflows, and respond to events in real-time.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queue service that enables you to decouple components of your application by sending messages between them. However, it does not provide the same level of event-driven architecture as EventBridge.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a push notification service that sends messages to multiple subscribers or clients. It is not designed for event-driven architecture.

Amazon Kinesis is a streaming service that enables you to build real-time data processing applications. While it can be used for event-driven architecture, it does not provide the same level of functionality as EventBridge.
