A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Rationale: The issue with the application performance at the beginning of the day is due to the increased traffic and usage during that time, which causes the instance types and sizes to struggle to keep up with the demand. To address this, we should schedule scaling to add more instances before the start of the day, when the traffic is relatively low. This will ensure that the application performance is optimal at the beginning of the day, as well as during the rest of the day."
