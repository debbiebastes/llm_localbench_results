A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Rationale:

To ensure that the sensitive PII of patients is protected, the Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption using a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach ensures that the master key is not stored or transmitted to AWS, and it is only accessible on the client side. The data will be encrypted before being sent to S3, ensuring that even if the data is intercepted or accessed unauthorized, it will be unreadable. Additionally, KMS-managed customer master keys are highly secure and compliant with various regulatory requirements. Therefore, option (B) is the best choice.
