A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 

A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Rationale: A 502 Bad Gateway error usually occurs when the server is unable to forward the request to the target application. In this case, the issue seems to be with the output of the Lambda function not being compatible with the API Gateway's expectations. Therefore, option (A) is the most likely root cause of the problem.
