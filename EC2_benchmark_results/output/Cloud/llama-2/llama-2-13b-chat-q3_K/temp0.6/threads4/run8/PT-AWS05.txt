A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: 

The correct answer is option C - Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. This approach allows for real-time processing of new changes made to the items in DynamoDB and storing them in another table without requiring any additional infrastructure, such as a server or database. It also eliminates the need for manual intervention or scripting, making it the most efficient and cost-effective solution.

Option A - Set up DynamoDB Accelerator is not relevant to this scenario as it is used for caching and performance optimization.

Option B - Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery is not necessary for this use case, as it is intended for disaster recovery and restoring data from a specific point in time, not for real-time data replication.

Option D - Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table is also not necessary, as it would require additional infrastructure and would not provide real-time processing of new changes.
