Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12

Explanation:

When resharding the stream, the number of open shards is increased to six. Since each instance has one KCL worker, and each shard requires one worker, we need at least six instances to process all six shards in parallel. Additionally, we want to maintain some headroom for failovers and maintenance, so we should launch at least 12 instances to achieve optimum performance.

Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that should be launched is (B) 12.
