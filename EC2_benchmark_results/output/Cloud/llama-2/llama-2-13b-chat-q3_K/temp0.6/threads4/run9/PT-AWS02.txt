The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the company’s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:

Option C is the most suitable solution in this scenario. AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides an easy way to deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances, and it integrates with AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes. This will allow the IT Security team to quickly mitigate the security risk and ensure compliance with the company’s security policies.

Option A is not suitable because it does not provide a comprehensive solution for patch management and compliance tracking. Option B is also not suitable because it does not integrate with Kibana, which is required for audit purposes. Option D is not feasible as it would require manual intervention and may not be able to ensure timely patching and compliance.
