(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation: 
The most cost-effective option would be (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option offers the lowest total cost of ownership over the 3-year period, as there is no upfront payment required and the hourly usage costs are lower compared to the other options.

Option (A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term would require an upfront payment, which may not be feasible for long-term commitments like a 3-year period. Option (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term also requires an upfront payment and offers higher hourly usage costs compared to option (B). Option (D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year would require frequent upfront payments and may not offer the same level of cost savings as the other options.

Therefore, option (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term offers the most cost-effective solution for the company's needs.
