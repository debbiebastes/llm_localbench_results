A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances."

Correct answer: (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances.

Explanation:

The issue faced by the tech company is related to the performance of their CRM application during the start of the day, which suggests that the demand for resources is increasing rapidly during this time period. To address this issue, a Predictive scaling policy can be configured for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances based on forecasted demand.

Predictive scaling policies use historical data and machine learning algorithms to predict future usage patterns and adjust resources accordingly. By configuring a Predictive scaling policy, the tech company can ensure that the correct number of instances are available during the start of the day to meet the increased demand, without over- or under-provisioning resources.

Option (A) is the most operationally efficient solution as it allows for automatic scaling based on forecasted demand, rather than relying on manual intervention or static thresholds. Options (B), (C), and (D) do not address the issue of forecasted demand and may not provide the optimal solution.
