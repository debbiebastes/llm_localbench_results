An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

Correct answer is (B).

Explanation:

Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) provides persistent block storage volumes that are ideal for mission-critical workloads. Object storage services like Amazon S3 and Amazon S3 Glacier are designed to store large amounts of data for long periods of time.

Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not intended for long-term use and are not suitable for mission-critical workloads. Option (C) is also incorrect because One Zone-IA is a storage class that is optimized for infrequently accessed data, but it does not provide the same level of durability as Amazon S3 Glacier.

Option (B) is the correct answer because EBS volumes are designed for long-term use and can be used to store mission-critical data. By using a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, you can ensure that your backup data is stored in a cost-effective and highly durable storage service.
