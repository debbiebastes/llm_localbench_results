A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

Explanation: The error code "502 Bad Gateway" suggests that the issue is with the upstream server, specifically the Lambda function. The fact that the developer received an XML response from the underlying function indicates that the Lambda function is properly invoked and returning a valid response. Therefore, the likely cause of the 502 error is that the output returned from the Lambda function is incompatible with the expected format or structure. This could be due to a misconfiguration of the Lambda function or an incorrect mapping of the function's output to the API Gateway's request.
