A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

In this scenario, the best option would be (B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway. This option allows you to control the amount of traffic that reaches the backend systems, reducing the load and preventing overload situations. Additionally, it also helps to improve response time and reduce latency, which is critical when dealing with real-time applications like cryptocurrency trading platforms.

Option A is not a good choice since it would involve changing the architecture of the platform, which could be risky and time-consuming. Option C would not make much difference in this scenario, as CloudFront is more focused on caching static content, rather than dynamic results from Lambda functions. Option D does not have any direct impact on traffic management or load balancing.
