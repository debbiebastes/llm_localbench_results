A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Rationale:  

In this scenario, the security engineer should implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key to ensure that both the unencrypted data and the master keys never leave the company's premises. By using a KMS-managed customer master key, the data will be encrypted on the client-side before being uploaded to S3, ensuring that the sensitive PII of patients is protected throughout the entire process. The KMS-managed customer master key will be securely stored within the company's premises, never leaving the premises and thus not subject to any regulatory or compliance risks.
