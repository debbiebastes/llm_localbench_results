An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B: Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

To meet the requirement of a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, option B is the best choice. Attaching an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume to an EC2 instance provides a persistent block storage solution that can be used for both the operating system and data storage needs.

Using Amazon S3 to store backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days meets the requirement of storing backup data in an object storage service and archiving older data. Amazon S3 Glacier provides long-term storage at a lower cost than standard Amazon S3 storage, making it suitable for infrequently accessed data.

Option A is not suitable because instance store volumes are not designed for persistent block storage and are only intended for temporary storage of the operating system and applications. Option C is not suitable because One Zone-IA is a less expensive storage class that is not designed for mission-critical workloads or long-term data storage.

Therefore, option B is the best choice to meet the given requirements.
