A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:
The cost-effective option would be to go with the No Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term (Option C). This option allows you to pay only for the instances you use and avoids upfront costs. The benefit of going with a Convertible Reserved Instance (Option A) is that it offers more flexibility in case the usage patterns change over time, but it comes at a higher cost.

Note: The assumption here is that the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years, which makes the No Upfront option more cost-effective in the long run.
