Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Explanation:

Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events) is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It provides a fully managed event bus that allows you to communicate between different services and microservices in your application, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure or complexity of implementing event routing.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queue service that enables you to decouple components of your application by using queues to pass messages between them. However, it does not provide an event bus and does not enable event-driven architecture.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a messaging service that sends notifications or messages to multiple subscribers or clients. It does not provide event routing or event-driven architecture capabilities.

Amazon Kinesis is a fully managed video and data streaming service that enables real-time processing of large datasets, but it does not provide event-driven architecture capabilities.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).
