A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

Correct Answer - A). Configuring a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group will allow you to adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances based on forecasted usage, ensuring that the application performs optimally during the start of the day.

Rationale:

Option A is the most operationally efficient solution as it allows for predictive scaling based on forecasted usage, allowing the Auto Scaling group to adjust the number of instances before the start of the day, when the increased demand is expected. This approach ensures that the application performs optimally during the start of the day, without over-provisioning or under-provisioning resources.

Option B (Dynamic scaling based on Memory utilization) and Option C (Scheduled scaling) do not address the issue of forecasted usage and may result in either over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources, leading to suboptimal performance. Option D (Dynamic scaling based on CPU utilization) does not account for the variation in usage patterns during different times of the day.

Therefore, Option A - Configuring a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group is the most operationally efficient solution to ensure that the application performs optimally at the beginning of the day.
