Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched to achieve optimal performance is (B) 12.
Explanation:
When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards is increased, which means more instances are required to process the increased volume of data. In this case, the stream has six open shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To achieve optimal performance, you would need 12 EC2 instances (6 shards x 2 workers per shard = 12 instances).
Option (A) 5 is incorrect because 5 instances are not enough to process the increased volume of data after resharding. Option (C) 3 is also incorrect because 3 instances are not enough to handle the increased load after resharding. Option (D) 6 is incorrect because 6 instances are already being used to process the stream before resharding, and adding more instances will not improve performance.
