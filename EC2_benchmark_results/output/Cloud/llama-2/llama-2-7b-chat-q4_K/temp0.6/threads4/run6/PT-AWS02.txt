The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
Option (A) is the most suitable solution because it leverages AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager to deploy the OS patches to the outdated EC2 instances. This approach ensures that all instances are updated with the latest security patches, which helps mitigate the security risk. Additionally, integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana allows for easy recording and tracking of any configuration changes, which is necessary for audit purposes.
Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. While this approach can also help mitigate the security risk, it may not be as efficient or effective as Option (A), as it requires setting up and managing multiple AWS services.
Option (C) uses AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. While this approach can simplify the patch management process, it may not provide the same level of visibility or tracking as Option (A).
Option (D) configures the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis. While this approach can help maintain security and compliance, it may not be as effective in mitigating immediate security risks, as the patches may not be deployed immediately upon discovery of the vulnerability.
