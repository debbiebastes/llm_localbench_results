A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation: AWS Lambda and API Gateway are designed to handle traffic spikes, but there are limitations to their scalability. To further increase the scalability of the backend systems, you can enable throttling limits in API Gateway to control the amount of traffic that reaches the backend. This will prevent the backend from becoming overwhelmed and crashing due to an unexpected influx of visitors.
Additionally, result caching in API Gateway can help reduce the load on the backend by serving pre-computed results instead of recalculating them every time a request is made. This can significantly reduce the response time and prevent the backend from becoming overwhelmed during traffic spikes.
Option (A) is not the best choice as it involves using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling, which may be more complex to set up and manage compared to throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway. Option (C) is also not the best choice as CloudFront can only act as a cache for HTTP traffic, and it may not be able to handle non-HTTP requests or responses from API Gateway. Option (D) is not relevant to this scenario.
