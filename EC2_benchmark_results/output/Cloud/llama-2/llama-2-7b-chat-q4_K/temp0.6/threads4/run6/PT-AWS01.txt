A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
B (Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.)
Explanation: In this scenario, the Security Engineer should implement Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key to ensure that sensitive PII data is encrypted at rest in S3. By using a KMS-managed customer master key, the security engineer can maintain control over the encryption keys and ensure that they are never sent to AWS, thereby meeting the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company.
Option A (Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key) is not suitable as it does not provide the same level of security as Option B. With this approach, the master key would be stored on the client side, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access or disclosure of the data.
Option C (Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key) is also not suitable as it requires the security engineer to provide the KMS-managed key to AWS, which goes against the compliance requirements of the company.
Option D (Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key) is not a valid option as it requires the security engineer to provide the encryption key to AWS, which again goes against the compliance requirements of the company.
