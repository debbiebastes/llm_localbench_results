A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Here's why this is the most efficient approach:
1. Ease of implementation: Using AWS Config rules to detect and remediate security groups that allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is a straightforward process that requires minimal effort and resources.
2. Scalability: As the number of developers or security groups grows, the AWS Config rule can automatically detect and remediate any security risks in near real-time. This ensures that the security of the system remains intact even as the environment evolves.
3. Automation: By associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule, you can automate the remediation process without requiring manual intervention. This saves time and reduces the risk of human error.
4. Consistency: Using AWS Config rules ensures consistency across all security groups and EC2 instances, which is essential for maintaining a secure environment.
5. Compliance: By using AWS Config rules to monitor and remediate security groups, you can demonstrate compliance with security policies and standards, such as PCI DSS or HIPAA.
While (B) Setting up a Transit VPC could also be an effective approach, it may not be the most efficient since it requires additional infrastructure and configuration to route traffic through the transit VPC. Similarly, (C) Blocking source IP addresses coming from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL can help mitigate the risk but does not address the root cause of the problem. Finally, (D) Using AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is a good idea, but it may not be able to detect and remediate security risks in real-time due to the complexity of the issue.
