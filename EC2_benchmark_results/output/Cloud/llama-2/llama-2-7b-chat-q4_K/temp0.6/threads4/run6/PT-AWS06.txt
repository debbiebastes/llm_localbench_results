A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B) The endpoint request timed-out. When a Lambda function is invoked through an AWS API Gateway proxy integration, any latency or errors in the backend can cause a 502 Bad Gateway error. This is because the API Gateway waits for the underlying Lambda function to complete before returning a response to the client. If the Lambda function takes too long to complete or encounters an error, it will return a timeout error, which will be passed back to the client as a 502 Bad Gateway error.
In this case, the developer mentioned that invoking the underlying Lambda function properly returned the result in XML format, which suggests that the Lambda function is working correctly and returning the expected output. Therefore, the most likely cause of the issue is that the request timed out before the Lambda function could complete or return its response.
