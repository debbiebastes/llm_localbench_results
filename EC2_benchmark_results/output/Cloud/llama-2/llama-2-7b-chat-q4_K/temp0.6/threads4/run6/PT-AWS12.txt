A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The most cost-effective option would be (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This is because the savings from using Reserved Instances are maximized when the instance is reserved for a longer period of time, such as 3 years. The Reserved Instance pricing model offers a significant discount compared to On-Demand pricing, and the upfront payment provides further cost savings.
Option (A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term is not the most cost-effective option because the savings from using Reserved Instances are limited to the first year of the term, after which the instance would be charged at On-Demand prices.
Option (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term is also not the most cost-effective option because it does not provide any savings compared to On-Demand pricing, and the instance would be charged at full On-Demand prices for the entire 3-year term.
Option (D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year is also not the most cost-effective option because the savings from using Reserved Instances are limited to the first year of the term, after which the instance would be charged at On-Demand prices.
