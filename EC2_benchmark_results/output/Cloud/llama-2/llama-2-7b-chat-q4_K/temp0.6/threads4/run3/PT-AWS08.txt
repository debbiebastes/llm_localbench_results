An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.
Explanation:
An EBS volume provides persistent block storage that can be used for mission-critical workloads. Since the backup data will be stored in Amazon S3, it makes sense to use an EBS volume as the storage solution for this requirement.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not recommended for long-term storage of critical data. Instance store volumes are stored on the instance itself and are not redundant, which means that they can be lost if the instance fails or is terminated.
Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a storage service designed for infrequently accessed data, whereas the backup data in this scenario needs to be stored for 30 days. Storing the data in Amazon S3 One Zone-IA would not provide sufficient durability and availability for this use case.
Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not supported in EC2 instances that use the HVM (Hypervisor) or Paravirt (Parallel Virtualization) hypervisors.
