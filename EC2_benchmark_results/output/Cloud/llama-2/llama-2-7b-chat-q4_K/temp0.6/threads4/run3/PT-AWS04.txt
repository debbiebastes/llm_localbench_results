Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation:
When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards is increased by dividing each existing shard into multiple new shards. This increases the throughput and processing capacity of the stream. To achieve optimum performance with the increased number of shards, you will need at least 6 EC2 instances, one for each new shard. Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch is 6.
Option (A) is incorrect because 5 EC2 instances are not enough to handle the increased load and processing requirements of a resharded Kinesis data stream with 6 open shards.
Option (B) is also incorrect because 12 EC2 instances would exceed the recommended upper limit for the number of instances that can be used in a Kinesis data stream, which is around 10-12 instances per stream.
Option (C) is not a valid choice because there is no mention of the number of EC2 instances in the problem statement.
