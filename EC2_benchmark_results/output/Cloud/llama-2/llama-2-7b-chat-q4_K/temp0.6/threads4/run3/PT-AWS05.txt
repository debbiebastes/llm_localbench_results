A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements is option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach provides several benefits:

1. Centralized monitoring: By using EventBridge, you can monitor all DynamoDB tables in a single place, making it easier to identify and troubleshoot issues.
2. Automated processing: By setting up a Lambda function as a rule target, you can automatically process new changes made to the items in DynamoDB and save them to the other table in another region without manual intervention.
3. Scalability: As your application grows, you can easily scale your EventBridge and Lambda function to handle increased data volumes.
4. Cost-effective: Using EventBridge and Lambda functions instead of DynamoDB Accelerator or Point-in-Time Recovery reduces costs by only charging for the resources used.
5. Flexible integration: You can integrate your application with other AWS services, such as CloudWatch, S3, or SNS, to create a more comprehensive monitoring and logging solution.
