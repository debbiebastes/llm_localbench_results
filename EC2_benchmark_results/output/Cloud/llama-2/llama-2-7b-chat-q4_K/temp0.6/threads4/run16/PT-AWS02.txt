The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
Option (A) deploys the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, which provides a unified management experience across multiple AWS services. This approach allows the IT Security team to easily manage and deploy patches to various EC2 instances simultaneously. Additionally, integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana enables the team to record and track any configuration changes, providing a comprehensive audit trail for compliance purposes.
Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems, which may not provide the same level of visibility and control as Option (A).
Option (C) uses AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances, but does not provide a unified management experience across multiple AWS services.
Option (D) configures the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis, which may not be a feasible or flexible solution in this scenario due to the urgent nature of the security risk.
