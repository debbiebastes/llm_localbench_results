A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.
Explanation:
In this scenario, the Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption using KMS-managed customer master keys to meet the compliance requirements. This approach ensures that the sensitive PII data is encrypted before it leaves the hospital's premises and is stored in Amazon S3. The KMS-managed customer master key provides additional security controls, as the hospital can manage and rotate its own encryption keys without involving AWS.
Option (A) is incorrect because client-side encryption with a client-side master key does not provide adequate protection for sensitive PII data. If an unauthorized party gains access to the client-side master key, they could potentially decrypt the data.
Option (C) is also incorrect because server-side encryption does not provide adequate protection for sensitive PII data. The hospital has strict compliance and regulatory requirements to meet, which cannot be achieved by storing unencrypted data in Amazon S3.
Option (D) is incorrect because the hospital's security policy may not allow the use of customer-provided encryption keys. Using a customer-provided key could pose a risk to the hospital's compliance and regulatory requirements.
