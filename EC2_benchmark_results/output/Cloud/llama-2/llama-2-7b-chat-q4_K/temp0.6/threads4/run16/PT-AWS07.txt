A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day is (C): Configuring a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day. This will allow for the instance count to increase gradually over time, rather than all at once when the office opens, which can help mitigate any performance issues during the early morning hours.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy is not the best option as it relies on historical data to predict future usage and may not account for unexpected spikes in traffic. Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy based on Memory utilization may also not be the best option as it can lead to over-provisioning of instances during non-peak hours, resulting in unnecessary costs. Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy based on CPU utilization is similar to option (B) and may also result in over-provisioning of instances during non-peak hours.
