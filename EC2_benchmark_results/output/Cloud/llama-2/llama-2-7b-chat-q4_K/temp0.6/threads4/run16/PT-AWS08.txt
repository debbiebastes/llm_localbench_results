An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The best option to meet the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Using Amazon S3 to store backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier is the appropriate solution because:
* EBS volumes provide persistent storage, which means that data stored on them will persist even if the instance is terminated or recreated.
* Amazon S3 provides scalable and durable storage for mission-critical workloads, and storing backup data in S3 ensures that it's available even after 30 days.
* Transitioning objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days is a cost-effective option for long-term archiving, as glacier provides a lower cost storage solution for infrequently accessed data.
In summary, (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance and use Amazon S3 to store backup data with a lifecycle policy that transitions objects to Amazon S3 Glacier is the best option to meet the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads.
