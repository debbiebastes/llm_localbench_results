Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched to achieve optimum performance in this scenario is (D) 6.
Explanation:
With six open shards, each instance can handle two shards, resulting in a total of 12 instances handling the entire stream. This configuration will provide optimal performance for processing the stream with six shards. Launching additional instances beyond six will not significantly improve performance and may result in increased costs.
