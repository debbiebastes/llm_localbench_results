A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (A): There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
When a Lambda function returns an XML format, it is expected to be processed by the AWS SDKs or other integrations that Amazon API Gateway uses to handle responses from Lambda functions. However, if the Lambda function returns something other than XML, such as JSON or a binary format, it may cause issues with the proxy integration and result in a 502 Bad Gateway error when called through Amazon API Gateway.
Therefore, option (A) is the most likely root cause of the issue.
