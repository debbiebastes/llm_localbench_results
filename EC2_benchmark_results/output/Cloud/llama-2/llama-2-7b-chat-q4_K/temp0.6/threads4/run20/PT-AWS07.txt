A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The answer is (C): Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
Explanation:
The issue at hand is that the application is slow during the start of the day, and this can be attributed to the instance sizes and types in use. On-Demand EC2 instances are launched with default configurations, which may not be optimized for peak usage hours. By implementing a Scheduled scaling policy, you can launch new instances before the start of the day, ensuring that there are enough instances available to handle the expected load during office hours. This will help distribute the workload more evenly across all instances and prevent any single instance from becoming overwhelmed, thus improving overall performance.
Option (A) does not address the issue directly as it only adjusts the number of instances based on predicted usage patterns, which may not always be accurate. Option (B) would also not work as memory utilization alone cannot determine when to launch new instances, and CPU utilization can fluctuate throughout the day. Finally, option (D) is incorrect because CPU utilization is not the only factor that determines when to launch new instances, and it may not be a reliable metric for predicting peak usage hours.
