The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (B): Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager is a fully managed service that automates the patching process for EC2 instances, including outdated operating systems. It can be used to deploy patches for various third-party software, as well as AWS-provided software. By using Patch Manager, the IT Security team can ensure that all EC2 instances are up-to-date with the latest security patches, reducing the risk of cyber security attacks.
Additionally, Amazon ES (Elasticsearch Service) is a fully managed service that provides search and analytics capabilities for AWS. It can be used to record and track any configuration changes made to the EC2 instances, providing a centralized audit trail for compliance purposes. By integrating Patch Manager with Amazon ES, the IT Security team can easily monitor and analyze any changes made to the patching process, ensuring that all configurations are up-to-date and secure.
Option (A) is not suitable because it does not provide a fully managed solution for patch management. Option (C) is also not suitable because AWS Config is focused on configuration management rather than patch management. Option (D) is not a feasible solution as it requires manual intervention to install patches on a weekly basis, which may lead to compliance and security risks.
