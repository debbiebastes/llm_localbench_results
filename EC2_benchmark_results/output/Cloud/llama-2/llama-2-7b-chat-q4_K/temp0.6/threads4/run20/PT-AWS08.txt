An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The best answer is (A): Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
* Instance store volumes are designed for use with AWS instances, providing fast storage access for running applications. However, they don't offer persistent storage, so the data stored on them is not guaranteed to be available after instance termination.
* Amazon S3 provides a highly durable and scalable object storage service that can store large amounts of data in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones. It also supports lifecycle policies that allow you to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier for long-term archiving after 30 days.
* Amazon S3 Glacier is a low-cost, archival storage service that provides long-term data preservation and retrieval. It's ideal for storing backup data that doesn't need to be accessed frequently.
By attaching an instance store volume in your EC2 instance and using Amazon S3 to store your backup data, you can meet the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads while also taking advantage of S3's scalability and archiving capabilities.
