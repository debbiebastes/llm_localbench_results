A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The most cost-effective option would be (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
Reserved Instances offer significant savings compared to On-Demand instances, especially when you commit to using them for a longer period of time. By choosing the All Upfront pricing option, you'll pay the entire yearly fee upfront and avoid any additional charges throughout the 3-year term. This can result in a significant cost savings compared to other options.
Option (A) is not the most cost-effective choice because it requires a larger upfront payment than the Standard Reserved Instance pricing option. Option (B) does not provide any cost savings for using the instance for more than 3 years, as the pricing is the same as On-Demand instances. Option (D) is also not the most cost-effective choice because it requires a renewal every year, which could result in additional costs compared to the All Upfront pricing option.
