A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk would be (A):
Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. This approach allows you to use AWS Config to monitor and enforce security policies across your AWS environment, including identifying and remediating security risks like the one described.
By associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule, you can automatically update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address when any new rules are detected that allow traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. This will ensure that all traffic to the EC2 instances goes through the corporate firewall, which is the intended security policy.
Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances, but this approach may not be as efficient or effective as using AWS Config rules for remediation, as it requires manual configuration of the Transit VPC and may not provide real-time detection of security risks.
Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, but this approach may not be practical or efficient for remediating the security risk, as it requires manual configuration of the Network ACL and may not provide real-time detection of security risks.
Option (D) uses AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but this approach may not be practical or efficient for remediating the security risk, as it requires manual configuration of AWS Shield and may not provide real-time detection of security risks.
