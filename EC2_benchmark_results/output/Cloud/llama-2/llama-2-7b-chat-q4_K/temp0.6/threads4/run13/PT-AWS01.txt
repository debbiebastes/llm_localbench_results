A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.
Explanation:
According to the scenario, the sensitive PII of patients should never be sent to AWS, which means that server-side encryption with a customer-provided key is not viable. Client-side encryption with a client-side master key is also not recommended because it requires the unencrypted data to be sent to AWS at some point during the encryption process, which violates compliance and regulatory requirements.
KMS-managed customer master keys provide an excellent solution for this scenario because they allow clients to manage their own encryption keys securely without sharing them with AWS. The Security Engineer can create a KMS customer master key in AWS and use it to encrypt the PII data stored in Amazon S3. This way, the master key is managed by the client rather than AWS, ensuring that the data remains encrypted even if the server is compromised or unauthorized access is gained.
In summary, implementing an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key is the most appropriate solution to ensure the sensitive PII of patients is properly encrypted and protected according to regulatory requirements.
