A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:
If the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years, the most cost-effective option would be (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This is because Reserved Instances provide significant savings compared to On-Demand instances, especially when used for long periods of time.
Option (A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term would provide the least cost savings over a 3-year period and would result in higher total costs compared to option (B).
Option (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term is also not the most cost-effective option as it does not provide any additional savings compared to option (B).
Option (D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year would also result in higher total costs over a 3-year period compared to option (B).
