Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The correct answer is (D) 6.
Explanation: When resharding a Kinesis data stream, you increase the number of open shards to six, which means that each instance now has two KCL workers instead of one. To achieve optimal performance, you should launch a maximum of six EC2 instances, matching the number of open shards. Launching more than six instances would not utilize the available resources efficiently and could result in underutilized capacity.
