The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (B): Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:
AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager can automatically deploy patches to EC2 instances, including those with old operating systems. This solution is suitable because it ensures that all EC2 instances are up-to-date with the latest security patches, which helps protect against various cyber security attacks. Additionally, using Amazon ES (Elasticsearch Service) to record and track any configuration changes provides an auditable trail of all changes made to the EC2 instances' configurations, which is important for compliance purposes.
Option (A) does not provide a comprehensive solution as it only deploys patches using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, without ensuring that the patches are actually applied to the EC2 instances. Option (C) requires configuring AWS Config, which is not necessary in this scenario. Option (D) assumes that the patches will be installed manually on a weekly basis, which may not be feasible or efficient for large-scale environments.
