An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
An EBS volume provides persistent block storage for EC2 instances, which makes it suitable for mission-critical workloads. By attaching an EBS volume to your EC2 instance, you can ensure that your data is persisted and available even if the instance fails or is terminated.
Using Amazon S3 to store your backup data allows you to take advantage of its scalability, durability, and low latency. You can configure a lifecycle policy in Amazon S3 to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which provides long-term archiving at a lower cost.
Option (A) is not suitable because instance store volumes are attached to the instance and do not provide persistence for data. Option (C) is not a valid option as Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not available in all regions. Option (D) is also not a valid option as Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not available in all regions.
