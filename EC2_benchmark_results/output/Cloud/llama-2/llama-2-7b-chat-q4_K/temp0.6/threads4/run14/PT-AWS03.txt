A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The most efficient way to remediate this security risk is (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and then associate an Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
This approach is efficient because it uses AWS Config rules to detect the security risk automatically, without requiring manual monitoring or testing. Additionally, using an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule allows for automated remediation, which can save time and resources compared to other methods.
Option (B) setting up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because it requires additional infrastructure and configuration, and may not be able to detect and remediate the security risk in real-time.
Option (C) blocking the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL is not a scalable or efficient solution because it requires manual configuration and monitoring, and may not be able to detect and remediate the security risk in real-time.
Option (D) using AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is not a practical solution for remediating this security risk because AWS Shield is primarily designed for monitoring and protecting against DDoS attacks, rather than detecting and remediating security risks related to inbound traffic from specific IP ranges.
