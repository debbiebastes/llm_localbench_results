A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (A): Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances based on historical data and forecasted usage patterns.
Explanation:
Predictive scaling allows you to anticipate future usage patterns by analyzing historical data, seasonality, and external factors such as weather, events, or time of day. By using predictive scaling, you can automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling group based on predicted usage patterns, ensuring that the application has sufficient resources to meet the demand at the start of the day.
In contrast, dynamic scaling policies launch new instances based on current usage patterns, which may not take into account future predictions or seasonality. Scheduled scaling policies, on the other hand, launch new instances at a fixed time each day, regardless of predicted usage patterns.
Therefore, implementing a predictive scaling policy is the most operationally efficient solution to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day.
