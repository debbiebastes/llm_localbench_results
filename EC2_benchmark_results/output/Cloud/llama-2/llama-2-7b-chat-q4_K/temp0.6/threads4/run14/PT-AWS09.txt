A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:
API Gateway is designed to handle high traffic and scalability, but it still needs some configuration to ensure that it can handle sudden spikes in traffic. One way to do this is by enabling throttling limits, which allow you to set maximum request rates for a given amount of time. This will help prevent the backend systems from being overwhelmed with requests.
Another option is to enable result caching in API Gateway. When result caching is enabled, API Gateway stores the results of successful requests and returns them directly from the cache instead of making a round trip to the backend. This can significantly reduce the load on the backend systems during traffic spikes.
Option (B) provides both throttling limits and result caching, which are essential features for protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes. Options (A), (C), and (D) do not address these features directly.
