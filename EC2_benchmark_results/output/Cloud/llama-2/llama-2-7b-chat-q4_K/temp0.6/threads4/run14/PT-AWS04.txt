Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation: When you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six, each instance will have two KCL workers. Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch is equal to the number of open shards, which is six in this case. Launching more than six EC2 instances will not improve performance and will only increase costs.
