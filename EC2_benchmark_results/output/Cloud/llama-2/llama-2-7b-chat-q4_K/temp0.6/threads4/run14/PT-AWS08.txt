An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume provides block-level storage for EC2 instances, which is ideal for mission-critical workloads that require persistent storage. Since the backup data will be stored for 30 days before being archived, an EBS volume is the best choice for this requirement as it provides a persistent and reliable storage solution.
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable and durable object storage service that can store large amounts of data. By configuring a lifecycle policy in Amazon S3, you can transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which provides long-term archiving and cold storage for infrequently accessed data.
Attaching an EBS volume in your EC2 instance and using Amazon S3 to store your backup data meets the requirement of providing a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads while also ensuring that the backup data is stored in a scalable and durable object storage service.
