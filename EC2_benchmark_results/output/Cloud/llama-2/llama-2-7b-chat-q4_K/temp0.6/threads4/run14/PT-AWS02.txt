The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (C): Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the IT Security team needs to urgently address the security vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances to protect the company's applications from cyber attacks. To mitigate the risk, AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager can be used to easily deploy OS patches to the outdated EC2 instances. This solution provides a swift and efficient way to address the security vulnerability without compromising on audit and compliance requirements.
AWS Config is also an essential component of this solution as it enables the IT Security team to track and record any configuration changes associated with the patching process. By integrating AWS Config with AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, the team can ensure that all patches are properly documented and audited for compliance purposes.
Option (A) does not provide a suitable solution because it involves deploying patches using Amazon QuickSight, which is not a suitable option for this scenario. Option (B) is also not the best choice because it relies on AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy patches but does not provide a comprehensive audit trail of configuration changes.
Option (D) is not a practical solution as it requires manual intervention to install patches on a weekly basis, which may not be feasible or efficient in addressing the security vulnerability.
