An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (A): Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
To meet the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, you should use an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Instance store volumes are designed to provide fast and consistent storage for running applications, making them ideal for mission-critical workloads.
To store backup data, you can use Amazon S3, which provides a scalable and durable storage solution for storing large amounts of data. You can configure a lifecycle policy in Amazon S3 to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which is an archival storage service that provides long-term data storage at a lower cost than Amazon S3.
Option (B) is incorrect because EBS volumes are designed for block-level storage and are not suitable for storing backup data. Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a single availability zone within a region, and it does not provide the scalability and durability required for mission-critical workloads. Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not designed to be used as archival storage, and they do not provide the same level of durability and availability as Amazon S3 or Amazon S3 Glacier.
