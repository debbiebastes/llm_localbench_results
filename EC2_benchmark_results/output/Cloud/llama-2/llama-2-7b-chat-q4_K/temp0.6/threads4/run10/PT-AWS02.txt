The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
In this scenario, the IT Security team needs to mitigate the security risk by deploying OS patches to the outdated EC2 instances as soon as possible. AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager provides a convenient solution for automating the patch deployment process across multiple EC2 instances at once. By integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, the team can track and record any changes made to the EC2 instances' configuration, which is essential for auditing purposes.
Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems, but it does not provide a way to integrate with Amazon QuickSight or Kibana for tracking changes. Option (C) uses AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy OS patches, but it does not offer a convenient way to track and record configuration changes. Option (D) configures the EC2 instances to automatically install patches on a weekly basis, but this may not be enough to address the immediate security risk.
