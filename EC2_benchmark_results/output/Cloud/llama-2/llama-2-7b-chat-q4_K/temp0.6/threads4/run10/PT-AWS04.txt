Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimal performance is (B) 12.

Explanation: When you reshard your stream, the number of open shards increases from four to six. This means that each KCL worker can handle twice as much data as before. To maintain the same level of performance, you need to launch twice as many EC2 instances, which is 12 in this case.
Option (A) is incorrect because it is too few instances. With only five instances, each worker would be handling more workload than it can handle efficiently, leading to slower processing times and reduced performance.
Option (C) is incorrect because it is not a valid scaling option. Scaling up the number of shards does not increase the number of KCL workers, so launching three additional instances would not improve performance.
Option (D) is incorrect because it is already the correct answer. The number of EC2 instances you should launch to achieve optimum performance is six.
