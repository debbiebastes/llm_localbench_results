A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (A): There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend. When a Lambda function returns an XML response, it is not compatible with the JSON format expected by the Amazon API Gateway proxy integration. This can result in a 502 Bad Gateway error when the proxy attempts to deserialize the response.
To fix this issue, the developer should ensure that the Lambda function returns a JSON response instead of XML. Alternatively, they can configure the proxy integration to accept XML responses and modify the API gateway to convert the XML response to JSON before returning it to the caller.
