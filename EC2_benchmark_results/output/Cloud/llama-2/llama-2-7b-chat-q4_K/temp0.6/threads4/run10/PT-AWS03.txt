A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Explanation:
This option is the most efficient because it leverages AWS Config, which can automatically detect changes to resources within an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, including security groups. By associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule, the security group can be automatically updated with the corporate firewall IP address without any manual intervention or additional configuration. This approach is more efficient than other options because it eliminates the need for manual monitoring and remediation of security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.
Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances, which can be a viable solution in some cases but is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because it requires additional configuration and infrastructure deployment.
Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, which can be a valid security measure but does not automatically update the security groups that allow inbound traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.
Option (D) uses AWS Shield to monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but it does not automatically update the security groups with the corporate firewall IP address.
