The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is: (A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
In this scenario, the IT Security team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk by deploying the OS patches to the old operating systems of several EC2 instances as soon as possible. The best solution is to use AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager to automate the process of deploying the patches to multiple instances at once, rather than manually patching each instance individually.
Additionally, it's important to record and track any configuration changes made during the patching process for audit purposes. Integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana provides a centralized platform for monitoring and tracking all changes made to the EC2 instances' configurations, including the patches deployed using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager.
Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, but it doesn't provide a way to automatically deploy patches to multiple instances at once. Option (C) uses AWS Config to record and track configuration changes, but it doesn't provide a centralized platform for monitoring and tracking all changes made to the EC2 instances' configurations. Option (D) configures the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install OS patches on a weekly basis, but this approach may not be able to address immediate security risks and may not provide real-time monitoring and tracking of configuration changes.
