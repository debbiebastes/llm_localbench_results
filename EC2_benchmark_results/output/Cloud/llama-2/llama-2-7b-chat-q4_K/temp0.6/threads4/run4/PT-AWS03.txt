A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to remediate this security risk would be option (A), using AWS Config rules to automatically detect and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach allows for automated detection and remediation, without requiring manual intervention or changes to the existing infrastructure.
Option (B) setting up a Transit VPC would require additional networking configurations and would not be as efficient as using AWS Config rules. Option (C) blocking source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACLs would also require manual intervention and may not cover all instances of unauthorized access.
Option (D), using AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, is an option but it would only detect new security group configurations and would not address existing security groups that have already been configured with unauthorized access.
Therefore, option (A) using AWS Config rules is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk.
