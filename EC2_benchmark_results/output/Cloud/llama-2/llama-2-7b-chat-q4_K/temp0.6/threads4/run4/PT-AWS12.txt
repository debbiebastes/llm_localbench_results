A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The most cost-effective option would be (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
Explanation:
The cost of using a Reserved EC2 instance is lower than an On-Demand instance when you commit to a long-term contract. The cost savings increase as the duration of the commitment increases. In this case, committing to a 3-year term would provide the most significant cost savings compared to a 1-year term or a no upfront payment option.
Option (A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term is the most expensive option as it does not provide any cost savings for a long-term commitment. Option (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term would also not provide any cost savings and is therefore not a viable option.
Option (D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year is also not a viable option as it does not provide any long-term commitment discounts.
