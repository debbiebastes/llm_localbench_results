A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:
In this scenario, API Gateway can be configured to handle increased traffic by enabling throttling limits and result caching. Throttling limits can be set up to control the number of requests that are allowed from a single IP address within a certain time frame, preventing any one user from overwhelming the system with too many requests. Result caching can be enabled to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need for API Gateway to perform expensive database queries each time a request is made.
Using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling (option A) would require more infrastructure setup and maintenance, while using CloudFront (option C) would only provide caching at the edge of the network, which may not be sufficient to handle increased traffic on the backend systems. Moving the Lambda function to a VPC (option D) is not relevant to protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes.
