Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6.

Explanation:
When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards is increased, which allows for more parallel processing and faster throughput. In this case, you have four shards initially, and after resharding, you now have six open shards. To achieve optimum performance, you should launch six EC2 instances to match the number of open shards.
Launching fewer than six EC2 instances will result in underutilization of resources and slower processing times, while launching more than six EC2 instances will lead to unnecessary costs and resource waste.
