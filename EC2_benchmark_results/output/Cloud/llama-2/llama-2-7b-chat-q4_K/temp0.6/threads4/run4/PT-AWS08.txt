An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The best option for meeting the organization's requirement is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.
Here's why:
1. Persistent block storage: An EBS volume provides persistent block storage, which means that data stored on it will be preserved even if the underlying EC2 instance is terminated or deleted. This meets the requirement of a mission-critical workload that requires a persistent block storage volume.
2. Object storage for backup data: You can store your backup data in Amazon S3, which provides low-cost, high- durability, and scalable object storage. After 30 days, you can transition the data to Amazon S3 Glacier or Amazon S3 One Zone-IA, depending on your requirements.
3. Lifecycle policy: You can configure a lifecycle policy in Amazon S3 to automatically transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. This will help you save storage costs and optimize your data archiving strategy.
While options (A) and (C) are also viable choices, they have some limitations. Option (A) uses instance store volumes, which have limited capacity and performance compared to EBS volumes. Option (C) uses Amazon S3 One Zone-IA, which has limited availability zones and may not be suitable for mission-critical workloads that require high availability.
