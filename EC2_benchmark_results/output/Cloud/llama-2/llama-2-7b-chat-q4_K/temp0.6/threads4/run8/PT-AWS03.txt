A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Explanation:
Using AWS Config rules, you can automatically detect any security groups that allow traffic directly from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Once the rule detects such a security group, it will trigger an AWS Lambda function to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is efficient because it automates the remediation process without requiring any manual intervention.
Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances, which may be a viable solution in some cases, but it's not the most efficient way to address this specific security risk. Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, which can also be effective, but it may not remediate the security risk completely, as some traffic may still pass through the security groups. Option (D) uses AWS Shield to monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but it doesn't provide any automatic remediation mechanism.
