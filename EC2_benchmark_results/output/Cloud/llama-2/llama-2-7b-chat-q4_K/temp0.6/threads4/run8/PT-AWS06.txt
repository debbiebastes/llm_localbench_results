A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B): The endpoint request timed-out.
Amazon API Gateway sets a default timeout for incoming requests, and if the Lambda function takes longer than that time to execute, the client will receive a 502 Bad Gateway error. This is especially true when working with external APIs or third-party services that may take some time to process their side of things. In this case, the developer can increase the timeout value by setting the `integration.response.timeOut` property in the API Gateway settings for the MyAPI integration.
