The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
Option A provides a comprehensive solution that addresses both the immediate security risk and audit requirements. Here's why:
1. Deploying patches using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager is a fast, secure, and efficient way to apply patches across multiple EC2 instances at once. It eliminates the need for manual intervention, reduces the risk of human error, and streamlines the patch deployment process.
2. Integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana provides a robust compliance monitoring solution. QuickSight can create detailed reports on patch statuses, compliance levels, and configuration changes across all EC2 instances. This enables the IT Security team to track compliance in real-time, identify potential security threats, and make data-driven decisions to mitigate risks.
3. By recording and tracking any configuration changes using Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, the team can provide a comprehensive audit trail of all patch and compliance-related activities. This is essential for regulatory compliance and ensures that the company remains secure and protected against cyber threats.
Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy patches for EC2 instances with old operating systems, but it doesn't provide a centralized solution for tracking compliance changes. Option (C) uses AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager for patch deployment but doesn't integrate with a compliance monitoring tool like Amazon QuickSight and Kibana. Option (D) assumes manual patch installation, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to track compliance changes.
In summary, the most suitable solution is to use AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager for patch deployment and Amazon QuickSight with Kibana for compliance monitoring and audit tracking. This approach provides a comprehensive and efficient solution for mitigating security risks and ensuring regulatory compliance.
