An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
An EBS volume provides block storage that is designed for persistent data storage, making it ideal for mission-critical workloads. By attaching an EBS volume in your EC2 instance, you can ensure that your data is stored on a reliable and high-performance storage solution.
Amazon S3 is a scalable, durable, and secure object storage service that provides a backup location for your data. You can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which will provide long-term archiving and retrieval capabilities at a lower cost than storing the data in S3.
Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not the best choice for this requirement because it provides a single availability zone for storage, which may not meet your organization's needs for disaster recovery and business continuity.
