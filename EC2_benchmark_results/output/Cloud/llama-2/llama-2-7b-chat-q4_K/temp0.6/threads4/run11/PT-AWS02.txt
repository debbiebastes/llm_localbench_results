The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes. This solution provides a comprehensive approach to mitigating security risks and ensuring compliance by automatically deploying patches to all affected instances, as well as providing a centralized platform for tracking and recording configuration changes.
Option (A) is the best choice because it leverages AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager to automate the deployment of OS patches to multiple EC2 instances. This ensures that all instances are up-to-date and protected against potential security threats. Additionally, by integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, the team can easily track and monitor any configuration changes, providing a complete audit trail for compliance purposes.
Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy patches, but it does not provide a centralized platform for tracking and recording configuration changes. Option (C) uses AWS Config to record and track configuration changes, but it does not automatically deploy patches to all affected instances. Option (D) configures automatic patch installations on a weekly basis, but this may not address the immediate security risk or provide a comprehensive solution for compliance purposes.
