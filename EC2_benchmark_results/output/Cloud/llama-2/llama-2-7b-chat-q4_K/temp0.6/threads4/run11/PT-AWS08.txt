An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume provides block-level storage for an EC2 instance, which is ideal for storing mission-critical data that needs to be persistently available. An EBS volume can also be used to store backup data, and you can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days.
Amazon S3 Glacier is a long-term archival storage service that provides very low-cost storage for data that is infrequently accessed or required to be stored for compliance reasons. By using an EBS volume and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition your backup data to Amazon S3 Glacier, you can store your mission-critical data in an optimized manner while ensuring that your backups are persisted for the required 30 days.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are ephemeral and do not provide persistent storage. Option (C) is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA does not provide the same level of durability as Amazon S3 Glacier, and it may not be suitable for storing mission-critical data. Option (D) is also incorrect because instance store volumes are ephemeral and do not provide persistent storage.
