A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.
Explanation:
Amazon S3 provides two types of encryption: client-side encryption and server-side encryption. Client-side encryption involves encrypting data before it is uploaded to S3, while server-side encryption involves encrypting data at rest in S3.
For sensitive data storage, the Security Engineer should choose a client-side encryption approach using a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach ensures that the master keys and unencrypted data are never sent to AWS, meeting the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company.
Option (A) is incorrect because client-side encryption requires a client-side master key, which should never be sent to AWS. Option (C) is also incorrect because server-side encryption involves encrypting data at rest in S3, which may not provide adequate protection for sensitive data. Option (D) is incorrect because customer provided keys are not recommended for high-security applications like this one.
