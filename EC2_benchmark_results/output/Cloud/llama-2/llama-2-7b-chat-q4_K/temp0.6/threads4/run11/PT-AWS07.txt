A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (C): Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day. This solution will ensure that additional instances are launched in advance to handle increased traffic during peak hours, thereby improving performance at the beginning of the day.
Explanation:
Option (A) is not the most operationally efficient solution as predictive scaling policies rely on historical data to make predictions about future usage, which may not accurately reflect current conditions.
Option (B) is also not the most operationally efficient solution as dynamic scaling policies launch instances based on real-time utilization metrics, which can lead to frequent scale changes and increased complexity in managing the Auto Scaling group.
Option (D) is not a feasible solution as it would require configuring a scaling policy based on CPU utilization, which may not be an accurate indicator of application performance during peak hours.
