A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Explanation:
Option (A) is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk because it leverages AWS Config, which is a fully managed service that allows you to manage and automate configuration items across your AWS resources. By using AWS Config rules, you can automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which is the source of the security risk.
Once the security group is identified, you can associate an Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This will automatically apply the necessary changes to the security group without manual intervention.
Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances, which may not be the most efficient solution as it requires additional infrastructure and configuration.
Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, which is a security control that can be used to restrict traffic flowing into or out of an AWS VPC. However, this approach may not be the most efficient as it does not address the root cause of the security risk and may require manual intervention to update the Network ACL.
Option (D) uses AWS Shield to monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but it does not provide a way to automatically remediate the security risk.
