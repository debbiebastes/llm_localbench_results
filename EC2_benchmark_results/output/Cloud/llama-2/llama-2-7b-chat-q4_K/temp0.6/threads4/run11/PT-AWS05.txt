A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements is option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, and set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
Here's why:
Option (A) DynamoDB Accelerator is not relevant to this scenario, as it's primarily designed for improving performance of large-scale DynamoDB tables.
Option (B) Enabling Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) would not help with the compliance requirement of recording and storing new changes in another table. PITR is a feature that allows you to restore your DynamoDB table to a specific point in time, but it doesn't provide any automated way to sync changes between tables.
Option (D) Enabling DynamoDB Streams would also not help with the compliance requirement of recording and storing new changes in another table. DynamoDB Streams are used for real-time processing and analyzing data streams, but they don't provide any automated way to sync changes between tables either.
Option (C) on the other hand, creates an EventBridge rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, such as new items being added or updated. Whenever an event occurs, a Lambda function is triggered, and the changes are saved to another DynamoDB table in another region. This approach provides a centralized and automated way to record and store new changes in another table, which meets the compliance requirement.
In summary, option (C) Create an Amazon EventBridge rule with a Lambda function as a target is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements of recording and storing new changes in another DynamoDB table in another region.
