The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (B): Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides a simple and automated way to manage patches across multiple EC2 instances. It can automatically detect and apply patches to instances with old operating systems, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities. Additionally, AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager integrates with Amazon ES (Elasticsearch), which is a fully managed service for search and analytics, allowing you to easily track and record any configuration changes.
Option (A) is not suitable because it involves using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, which is not designed for managing patches across multiple instances. Option (C) is also not the best choice because while it provides a simple way to deploy OS patches, it does not provide a comprehensive solution for tracking and recording configuration changes. Option (D) is not feasible because automatic patch installation on a weekly basis may not be sufficient to address immediate security risks.
