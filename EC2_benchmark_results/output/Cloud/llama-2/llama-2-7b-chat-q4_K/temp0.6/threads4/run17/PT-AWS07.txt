A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The most operationally efficient solution to ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day is: (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
Explanation: The issue with slow performance during the early morning hours can be attributed to the time it takes for the instances to spin up and become available for use. By configuring a scheduled scaling policy, you can launch new instances before the start of the day, allowing them to be available for use when users log in. This will help to improve the overall performance of the application during peak usage hours.
Option (A) is incorrect because predictive scaling policies do not take into account the specific needs of the application during peak usage hours. Option (B) is also incorrect because dynamic scaling policies are not ideal for applications that require a consistent level of performance throughout the day. Option (D) is incorrect because CPU utilization is not necessarily an indicator of performance issues, and may not be the best metric to use when configuring a scaling policy.
