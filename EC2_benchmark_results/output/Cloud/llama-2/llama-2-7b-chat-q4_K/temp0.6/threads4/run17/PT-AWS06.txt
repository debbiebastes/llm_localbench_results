A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The most likely root cause of this issue is (B): The endpoint request timed-out. When a Lambda function is invoked through an API Gateway, the function call is proxied to the Lambda runtime, and then the response is returned back to the client through the API Gateway. If the Lambda function takes too long to respond, the API Gateway will return a 502 Bad Gateway error.
In this case, it's possible that the underlying Lambda function is taking longer than expected to execute, causing the request to timeout and resulting in the 502 error being returned to the client.
