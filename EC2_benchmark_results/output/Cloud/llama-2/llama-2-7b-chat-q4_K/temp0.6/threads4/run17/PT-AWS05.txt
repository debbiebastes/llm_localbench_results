A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The best solution would be option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table. This approach provides the following benefits:

1. Cost-effective: EventBridge is a fully managed service, so you don't have to worry about provisioning or scaling any infrastructure.
2. Scalable: EventBridge can handle a large volume of events and automatically scales to meet your needs.
3. Flexible: You can use EventBridge with other AWS services like Lambda, CloudWatch, and SNS to build complex event-driven architectures.
4. Easy to set up: Creating an EventBridge rule is easy, and you don't need extensive knowledge of AWS or programming skills to set it up.
5. Audit compliance: Using EventBridge to track events in DynamoDB provides a complete audit trail of all changes made to the database, which helps ensure compliance with IT policies and regulations.
6. Low maintenance: Once set up, an EventBridge rule requires minimal maintenance, as AWS handles scaling, patching, and backups automatically.
7. Integration with other services: EventBridge can integrate with other AWS services like Lambda, CloudWatch, and SNS to build complex event-driven architectures.
8. Real-time monitoring: EventBridge provides real-time monitoring of events in DynamoDB, allowing you to quickly identify and respond to any issues or errors.
9. Automated backup: By enabling EventBridge, you can automatically capture a backup of your DynamoDB table changes, providing an additional layer of protection against data loss.
10. Cost-effective backup solution: EventBridge provides a cost-effective backup solution compared to other AWS services like DynamoDB Backup and Restore or Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration.
Therefore, option (C) is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements in this scenario.
