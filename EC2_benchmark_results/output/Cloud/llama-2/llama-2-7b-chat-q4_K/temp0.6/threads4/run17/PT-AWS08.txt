An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
An EBS volume provides persistent block storage for your EC2 instance, which meets the requirement of a mission-critical workload. To store the backup data in an object storage service, you can attach an EBS volume and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. This will provide long-term archiving for the backup data while keeping it accessible within 30 days.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are ephemeral, meaning they are deleted when the EC2 instance is terminated. Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a regional storage location that does not provide the necessary long-term archiving capabilities. Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not available in all regions.
