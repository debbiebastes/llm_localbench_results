A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:
To meet the requirement of not sending sensitive PII data to AWS, the Security Engineer should implement client-side encryption using a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach ensures that the master key is managed and protected by the organization rather than being stored in AWS. The S3 bucket will be encrypted at rest using this master key, ensuring that even if an unauthorized party gains access to the S3 bucket, they cannot read or decrypt the data without the proper decryption key.
Option (A) is incorrect because client-side encryption with a client-side master key would require sending the master key to AWS, which violates compliance and regulatory requirements. Option (C) is also incorrect because server-side encryption requires storing the master key in AWS, which is not allowed for sensitive PII data. Option (D) is incorrect because customer provided keys are not supported by AWS S3.
