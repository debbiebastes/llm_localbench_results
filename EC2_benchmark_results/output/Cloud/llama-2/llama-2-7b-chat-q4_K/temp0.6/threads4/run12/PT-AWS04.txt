Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The maximum number of EC2 instances that you can launch to achieve optimum performance is (B) 12.
Explanation:
When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards is increased, which means that more instances are required to process the increased volume of data. In this case, resharding the stream from four shards to six shards requires twice as many EC2 instances (i.e., 6 x 2 = 12).
Option (A) 5 is incorrect because five instances are not enough to handle the increased volume of data resulting from resharding the stream. Option (C) 3 is also incorrect because three instances are insufficient to process the increased volume of data. Option (D) 6 is incorrect because six instances are already in use before resharding, and launching more instances would not improve performance.
