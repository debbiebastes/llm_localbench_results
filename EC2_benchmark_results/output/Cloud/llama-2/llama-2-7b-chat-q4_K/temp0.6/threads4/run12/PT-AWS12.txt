A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The most cost-effective option for the company would be (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This is because:
* Reserved Instances provide a significant discount compared to On-Demand EC2 instances, especially for long-term commitments.
* By committing to a 3-year term, the company can take advantage of the higher discount provided by Standard Reserved Instances, which offer a flat hourly rate for a fixed number of hours per year.
* The All Upfront pricing option allows the company to pay upfront for the entire 3-year term, which can help reduce the overall cost of the instance.
In summary, option (C) provides the most cost savings for the company over a 3-year period due to the combination of Reserved Instances and Standard Reserved Instances pricing.
