A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (A): Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances.
Predictive scaling uses machine learning algorithms to predict future usage patterns and automatically adjusts the number of instances based on those predictions. This can help ensure that the application has sufficient instances available at the start of the day to handle the increased demand, reducing the likelihood of slow performance. In contrast, dynamic scaling policies rely solely on current utilization metrics, which may not accurately reflect future usage patterns. Scheduled scaling policies are not necessary in this scenario as they would only adjust the number of instances during specific time intervals, rather than predicting and adjusting based on future usage patterns. Finally, CPU utilization is just one of many factors that can affect application performance, and may not be the most relevant metric for predicting demand in this scenario.
