A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk would be option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
This approach is efficient because:

1. AWS Config rules can automatically detect any changes made to security groups, including the addition of rules that allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. This means that the remediation process will run continuously in the background without requiring manual monitoring or intervention.
2. The Systems Manager Automation document can be used to automatically update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address, which will prevent any further traffic from flowing into the EC2 instances from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. This will help prevent unauthorized access and reduce the risk of a security breach.
3. The use of AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule will allow for scalable and cost-effective remediation, as the Lambda function can be triggered by changes to the security groups and will only run when there are actual changes to remediate. This means that resources will not be wasted on unnecessary remediation tasks.
Overall, option (A) provides a efficient and automated solution for remediating this security risk.
