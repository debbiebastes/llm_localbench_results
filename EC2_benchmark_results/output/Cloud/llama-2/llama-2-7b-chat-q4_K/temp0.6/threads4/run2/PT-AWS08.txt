An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
To meet the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, you should choose option (A) or option (B).
Option (A) is the better choice because instance store volumes are designed to provide high performance and low latency, which is critical for mission-critical workloads. Instance store volumes are also persisted by default, meaning that they will continue to exist even if the instance is terminated or stopped.
Option (B) is a good choice as well, but it may not be the best option if you need high performance and low latency, since Amazon EBS volumes can have higher latency than instance store volumes. However, Amazon EBS volumes are designed for block-level storage and offer durability and redundancy features that can help ensure data persistence.
Option (C) is not a good choice because Amazon S3 is an object storage service and does not provide the persistent block storage volume that you need for mission-critical workloads. Option (D) is also not a good choice because instance store volumes are not designed to provide the level of performance and persistence required for mission-critical workloads.
