A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The Security Engineer should implement (B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.
Explanation:
As the sensitive PII data is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, it is essential to ensure that the data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. Since the company's policy requires that the master keys should never be sent to AWS, client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key is the best option.
Option (A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key can lead to issues if the client machine is compromised, as the unencrypted data will be accessible on the client machine. Similarly, option (C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a customer provided key does not meet regulatory requirements as the customer must manage their own keys. Option (D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with KMS managed key is not mentioned in the question.
Therefore, option (B) is the best answer to ensure that the sensitive PII data is encrypted both in transit and at rest while complying with the company's strict security policies and regulatory requirements.
