A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (A): Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances. This solution will allow the application to scale up before the start of the day, reducing the likelihood of slow performance during the morning rush hour.
Predictive scaling is a more operationally efficient solution than dynamic or scheduled scaling because it uses historical data and machine learning algorithms to predict future resource usage, rather than reacting to current resource usage. By configuring a predictive scaling policy, the Auto Scaling group can anticipate increased demand before it happens and scale up the number of instances accordingly, ensuring that the application performs optimally from the start of the day.
