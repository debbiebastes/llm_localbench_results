Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched to achieve optimum performance is (D) 6.
Explanation:
With a total of six open shards, each instance can handle one-third of the data stream's processing load, resulting in a more even distribution of work and better overall performance. Launching additional EC2 instances beyond this point would not significantly improve performance and may actually decrease it due to increased resource contention and fragmentation.
