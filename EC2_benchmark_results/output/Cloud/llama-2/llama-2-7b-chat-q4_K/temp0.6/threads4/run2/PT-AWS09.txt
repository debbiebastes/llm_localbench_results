A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
This is the best solution for protecting the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes. Using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling provides a more scalable and highly available architecture that can handle an increase in traffic more efficiently than AWS Lambda and API Gateway. By scaling horizontally with multiple EC2 instances, you can distribute the load across multiple servers and maintain high availability even during peak traffic times.
Option (A) is the best answer because it provides a more scalable and highly available architecture that can handle increased traffic more efficiently than AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
