A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:
The Security Engineer should implement Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key to meet the compliance requirements of the company. This approach ensures that the sensitive PII data remains encrypted both in transit and at rest, even if an unauthorized party gains access to the AWS infrastructure.
Option A is incorrect because client-side encryption with a client-side master key does not provide sufficient security for sensitive data, as the master key would be stored on the client side and could potentially be compromised.
Option C is incorrect because server-side encryption with a customer provided key is not secure, as the customer would need to provide the unencrypted data to AWS to comply with the strict compliance requirements of the company.
Option D is incorrect because Amazon S3 does not support server-side encryption with a KMS managed key for client-side encryption.
