The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, and integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
In this scenario, the IT Security team needs to urgently address the security risk posed by the outdated operating systems on several EC2 instances. The most efficient way to do this is by using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, which allows for automated patching of EC2 instances without requiring any manual intervention. This solution will ensure that all affected instances are promptly updated with the latest security patches.
Additionally, integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana will provide a centralized platform for tracking and recording any changes made to the configuration of the patched instances. This will help maintain audit trails and demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements.
Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, which can automate patching processes, but it does not provide real-time monitoring and tracking of patch statuses like Option (A) does. Option (C) uses AWS Config to record and track configuration changes, but it does not provide a unified view of all configuration changes across multiple EC2 instances. Option (D) configures the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install OS patches on a weekly basis, which may not be practical or feasible in some cases, especially if the instances are running critical applications that cannot be interrupted for maintenance.
