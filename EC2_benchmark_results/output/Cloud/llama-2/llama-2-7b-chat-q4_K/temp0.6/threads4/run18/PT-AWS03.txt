A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Explanation:
The best approach is to use AWS Config rules to automatically detect any security groups that allow traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which is not a valid source IP range for any legitimate traffic. By using AWS Config, you can create a rule that monitors for this specific security risk and takes action to remediate it.
Option (A) provides a proactive approach by detecting and remediating the security risk in real-time, without relying on manual intervention or any additional monitoring tools. Additionally, using Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function allows for efficient and consistent remediation of multiple security groups.
Options (B) and (C) are not as efficient as they do not provide real-time detection and automated remediation. Option (B) would require manual configuration of a transit VPC, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Option (C) would require manually blocking the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which can lead to false positives or negatives and may not be scalable for large-scale environments.
Option (D) is not a feasible solution as AWS Shield is designed to monitor and detect DDoS attacks, not security risks related to inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.
