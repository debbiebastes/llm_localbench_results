A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The most likely root cause of this issue is (B) The endpoint request timed-out.

When a Lambda function is invoked through an API Gateway proxy integration, the API Gateway handles the communication between the client and the Lambda function. If the Lambda function takes too long to respond, the API Gateway will timeout and return a 502 Bad Gateway error to the client. In this case, the developer received a 502 error, which indicates that the Lambda function took too long to respond.
Option (A) is incorrect because there is no incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend. The XML format of the result is not an issue.
Option (C) is also incorrect because there is no evidence of occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
Option (D) is incorrect because the API name is valid, as confirmed by the developer.
