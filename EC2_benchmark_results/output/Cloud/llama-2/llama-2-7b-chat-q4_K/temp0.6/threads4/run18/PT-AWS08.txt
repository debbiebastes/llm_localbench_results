An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
An EBS volume provides persistent block storage that can be used for mission-critical workloads, as required by the organization. By attaching an EBS volume to an EC2 instance, you ensure that the data is stored persistently and can be accessed quickly.
To store the backup data in Amazon S3, you can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. This will provide long-term archiving for the backup data at a lower cost than storing it in Amazon S3 Standard or Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not meant for mission-critical workloads and do not provide persistence. Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA does not provide the required archiving functionality. Option (D) is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a storage class that provides high availability and low latency for data accessed from within a single AWS region, but it does not provide long-term archiving capabilities.
