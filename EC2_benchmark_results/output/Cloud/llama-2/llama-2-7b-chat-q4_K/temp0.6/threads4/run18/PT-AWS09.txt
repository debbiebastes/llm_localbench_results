A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

The correct answer is (B): Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Explanation:
API Gateway provides built-in features for handling traffic spikes, including throttling limits and result caching. By enabling these features, you can limit the number of requests that a client can make to your backend system within a given time period (throttling), and cache the results of frequently requested endpoints to reduce the load on your backend systems.
Using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling is a more scalable and highly available architecture, but it may not be necessary in this scenario, as API Gateway provides built-in scaling capabilities.
CloudFront can be used to cache content at edge locations closer to the end-user, reducing the latency and load on your backend systems, but it is not directly related to protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes.
Moving the Lambda function to a VPC is not necessary in this scenario as AWS Lambda already provides isolation and security features by running the function in an isolated environment.
