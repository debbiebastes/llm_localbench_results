A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day is (C): Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
Explanation:
The issue at hand is that the application is slow during the start of the day, which suggests that there may not be enough instances available to handle the workload. By configuring a Scheduled scaling policy, you can launch new instances before the start of the day to ensure that there are sufficient resources available to handle the expected workload. This will help improve the performance of the application during the start of the day.
Option (A) is incorrect because Predictive scaling policies do not take into account the current workload, and may not launch new instances until a certain threshold is reached. Option (B) is also incorrect because Dynamic scaling policies are triggered by changes in resource utilization, and may not launch new instances until there is a significant change in CPU or Memory utilization. Option (D) is incorrect because CPU utilization is not the only factor that affects application performance, and launching instances based solely on CPU utilization may not address the issue at hand.
Option (C), on the other hand, allows you to specify a schedule for when new instances should be launched, ensuring that there are sufficient resources available during peak hours. By configuring a Scheduled scaling policy to launch new instances before the start of the day, you can ensure that the application has enough resources to handle the expected workload during office hours.
