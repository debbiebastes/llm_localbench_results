A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements is option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:
Option (C) creates a reliable and scalable solution for recording all changes made to the items in DynamoDB. EventBridge allows you to create rules that track events in DynamoDB, such as insertions, updates, and deletions. By setting up an EventBridge rule, you can automatically capture these events and pass them to a Lambda function as a rule target. The Lambda function can then process the new changes and save them to the other DynamoDB table in another region.
Option (A) is not ideal because it requires additional infrastructure in the form of DynamoDB Accelerator, which is an optional feature that adds additional latency to your application.
Option (B) is also not ideal because it relies on Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR), which is a feature that allows you to restore DynamoDB tables to a point in time, but it does not provide real-time tracking of changes. PITR can be used for other use cases like data recovery or compliance requirements, but for real-time change logging, EventBridge is a more suitable solution.
Option (D) is also not ideal because DynamoDB Streams is intended to capture only specific events in DynamoDB, such as insertions and deletes of items. It does not provide the ability to capture all changes made to an item, which may be necessary for compliance reasons.
