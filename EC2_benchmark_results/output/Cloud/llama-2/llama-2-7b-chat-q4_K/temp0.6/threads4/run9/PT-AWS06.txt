A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is:

(B) The endpoint request timed-out.

When a Lambda function is called through an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration, the function has a time limit for executing. If the function takes longer than the specified time limit (known as the timeout), the API Gateway returns a 502 Bad Gateway error. In this case, it's likely that the Lambda function took longer than the timeout to execute, causing the 502 error to be returned to the client.
