The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (B): Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the IT Security team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk by patching the outdated EC2 instances. The best solution is to use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, which allows for easy deployment of patches across multiple EC2 instances at once. This will help reduce the risk of security breaches and ensure compliance with security standards.
Additionally, Amazon ES (Elasticsearch Service) can be used to record and track any configuration changes made during the patching process, which is important for audit purposes.
Option (A) is not the best solution as it involves integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, which may not be necessary in this scenario. Option (C) is also not the best solution as AWS Config does not provide the same level of automation and ease of use as AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager.
Option (D) is not a feasible solution as it involves configuring the EC2 instances to automatically install patches on a weekly basis, which may not be practical or feasible in all cases.
