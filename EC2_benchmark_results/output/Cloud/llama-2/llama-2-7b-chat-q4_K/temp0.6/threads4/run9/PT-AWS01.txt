A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Reasoning: To comply with the company's strict compliance and regulatory requirements, it is necessary to keep sensitive PII data encrypted even when it is in transit or at rest. Client-side encryption using a KMS-managed customer master key provides an additional layer of security as the keys are managed by AWS Key Management Service (KMS), which provides secure and reliable key management capabilities. This ensures that the master keys and unencrypted data are never sent to AWS, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or breaches.
