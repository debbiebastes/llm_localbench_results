Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched to achieve optimum performance is (D) 6.
Explanation:
When resharding the Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards increased from 4 to 6. This means that each instance now has two KCL workers instead of one, which doubles the processing capacity.
To achieve optimum performance, you should launch a maximum of 6 EC2 instances, each with two KCL workers, for a total of 12 KCL workers. Launching more than 6 instances would not provide any additional performance benefits and would only increase costs.
Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 6.
