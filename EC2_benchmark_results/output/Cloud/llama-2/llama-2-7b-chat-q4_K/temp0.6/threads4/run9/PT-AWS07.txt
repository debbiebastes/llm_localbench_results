A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution would be:
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation:
As the users are complaining about slow performance at the beginning of the day, it means that there is an increased demand for instances during this time. Configuring a scheduled scaling policy would allow the company to launch new instances before the start of the day, which would help in meeting the increased demand and provide better performance at the beginning of the day. This would ensure that the application works properly from the very beginning, without any slowdowns or performance issues.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy, while it can predict the future load, might not always be accurate in detecting the actual load. Also, it would require more instances to be running at all times, which could increase costs.
Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy based on memory utilization might not be effective as the application's performance issues are not solely due to high memory utilization. It also might lead to unnecessary instance launches if the memory utilization is not consistently high.
Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy based on CPU utilization might also not be effective as it would not address the issue of increased demand during the beginning of the day.
