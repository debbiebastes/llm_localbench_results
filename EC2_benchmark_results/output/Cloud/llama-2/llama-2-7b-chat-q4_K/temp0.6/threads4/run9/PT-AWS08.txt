An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (A): Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
Persistent block storage volumes are recommended for mission-critical workloads, which is why an organization wants to use an instance store volume in their existing EC2 instance. Instance store volumes are designed to provide high performance and low latency for applications that require fast access to data.
To store the backup data in a scalable and cost-effective manner, Amazon S3 can be used as the storage location for the backup files. Since the data is not intended to be accessed frequently, a lifecycle policy can be configured to transition the objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. This will provide a cost-effective storage solution with low latency and high availability.
Option (B) is incorrect because EBS volumes are designed for block-level storage and do not offer the same level of performance as instance store volumes. Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA does not provide the same level of performance or scalability as Amazon S3 Glacier, which is why it is not recommended for mission-critical workloads. Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not designed to be used with Amazon S3, and would not provide the necessary performance or scalability for a mission-critical workload.
