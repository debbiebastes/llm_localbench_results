A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk would be (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Explanation:
Option (A) uses AWS Config to automatically detect and remediate the security risk. AWS Config is a fully managed service that allows you to manage and automate the configuration of AWS resources. By using AWS Config, you can define rules that specify the desired state of your AWS resources and have those rules automatically enforced.
In this scenario, you can create an AWS Config rule that detects security groups with inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. When the rule is triggered, it will update the security group to allow only traffic from the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is efficient because it automates the remediation process without requiring manual intervention or additional resources.
Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances. While this option may provide some benefits in terms of network topology, it is not the most efficient way to remediate the security risk because it requires manual configuration and does not automate the remediation process.
Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL. While this approach may provide some temporary mitigation of the security risk, it is not a sustainable solution because it does not address the root cause of the problem and requires ongoing manual maintenance to update the Network ACL.
Option (D) uses AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. While this option may provide some benefits in terms of automated monitoring, it does not address the root cause of the security risk and requires additional resources and costs to implement.
In summary, option (A) is the most efficient way to automatically remediate the security risk because it uses AWS Config rules to automate the remediation process without requiring manual intervention or additional resources.
