A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements is option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

In this scenario, the best approach is to use Amazon EventBridge to track events in the original DynamoDB table and trigger a Lambda function to save the changes to the secondary table in another region. This approach provides several benefits:
1. Scalability: EventBridge can handle a large volume of events without any performance issues, making it ideal for high-traffic applications.
2. Cost-effective: EventBridge is a fully managed service, which means that AWS handles the underlying infrastructure, reducing operational costs and overhead.
3. Flexibility: EventBridge supports a wide range of event sources, including DynamoDB, allowing you to integrate it with other AWS services and third-party applications.
4. Ease of use: EventBridge provides an intuitive interface for defining rules and triggers, making it easy to set up and manage.
5. Security: EventBridge has built-in security features, such as access controls and encryption, ensuring that sensitive data is protected throughout the event processing flow.
6. Monitoring and Logging: EventBridge provides detailed logging and monitoring capabilities, allowing you to track events and identify potential issues in real-time.
7. Integration with other AWS services: EventBridge can be easily integrated with other AWS services, such as Lambda, S3, and CloudWatch, allowing you to create a comprehensive event-driven architecture.
8. Compliance: By using EventBridge to track events in DynamoDB, you can ensure that all changes are recorded and stored in another table in another region, meeting the compliance requirements.
In summary, option (C) is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements as it provides a scalable, cost-effective, flexible, easy-to-use, secure, and integrated solution for tracking events in DynamoDB and saving new changes to another table in another region.
