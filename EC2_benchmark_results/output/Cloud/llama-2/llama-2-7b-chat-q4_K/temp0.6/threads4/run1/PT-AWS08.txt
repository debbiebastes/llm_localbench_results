An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
An EBS volume provides persistent block storage, which meets the requirement of a mission-critical workload. You can attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance and use it to store your backup data. To meet the 30-day retention policy, you can configure a lifecycle policy in Amazon S3 that moves the objects from the standard storage class to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. Amazon S3 Glacier provides long-term archival storage at a lower cost than standard storage, which meets the requirement of storing backup data for mission-critical workloads.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not persistent and do not provide the required level of durability for mission-critical workloads. Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA does not provide long-term archival storage, which is a requirement for meeting the 30-day retention policy. Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not supported in EC2 instances.
