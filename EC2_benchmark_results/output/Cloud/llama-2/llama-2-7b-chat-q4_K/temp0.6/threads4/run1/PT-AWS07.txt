A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution to implement would be (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day. This approach would ensure that additional instances are launched before the start of the workday, allowing the application to handle increased traffic and load at the beginning of the day when user activity is highest.
Scheduled scaling allows you to define a schedule for scaling your resources up or down based on predefined conditions. In this case, you can configure the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the workday, ensuring that the application has enough capacity to handle the expected load at the beginning of the day. This would help to improve the performance and user experience during peak hours.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy is not the most operationally efficient solution as it relies on machine learning algorithms to predict future load, which can be complex and time-consuming to set up and maintain. Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on Memory utilization may also not be the most operationally efficient solution as it can lead to overprovisioning of resources, resulting in unnecessary costs. Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on CPU utilization is similar to option (B) and may also result in overprovisioning of resources.
