A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The most cost-effective option would be (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
Explanation:
A reserved instance provides a discount of up to 75% compared to on-demand pricing, depending on the duration of the reservation. The longer the reservation, the greater the discount. In this case, choosing a 3-year term would provide the greatest discount, resulting in the lowest cost.
Option (A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term provides the least discount and would result in higher costs over the 3-year period. Option (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term also provides little to no discount and would be more expensive than option (C). Option (D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year would provide some savings compared to on-demand pricing but would still be more expensive than option (C) over the 3-year period.
