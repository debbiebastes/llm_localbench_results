A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key is the correct answer.
Explanation: The hospital's security engineer must ensure that the sensitive patient data stored in the Amazon S3 bucket is securely encrypted to meet compliance and regulatory requirements. Encrypting the data at rest using a client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key provides an additional layer of security as only authorized users can access the decryption keys. This approach ensures that the hospital's sensitive data remains protected even if the Amazon S3 bucket is compromised or accessed by unauthorized parties.
Option A, implementing an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key, does not meet this requirement as the master key is stored on the client side and could potentially be exposed in case of a breach. Option C, implementing an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key, is also not suitable as it relies on AWS to manage the encryption keys, which may not meet compliance requirements. Finally, option D, implementing an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key, is not a recommended approach as it would require the hospital to manage and store their own encryption keys, which could be vulnerable to exposure or compromise.
