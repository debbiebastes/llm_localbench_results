The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (B): Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides a centralized and automated way to manage patches across multiple EC2 instances. It allows you to easily deploy patches for outdated operating systems, including those that are no longer supported by the vendor. By using Patch Manager, you can ensure that all affected instances are updated with the latest security patches in a timely manner.
Amazon ES (Elasticsearch) is a highly scalable and flexible search and analytics service that can be used to record and track any configuration changes made to the EC2 instances. By integrating Amazon ES with Patch Manager, you can easily monitor and audit all changes made to the instances, including patch management activities.
Option (A) uses AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, which is a new service that was introduced in 2019. While this service provides some benefits for managing EC2 instances, it may not be the best choice for managing patches for outdated operating systems. Option (C) uses AWS Config, which is a service that provides a way to manage and automate configuration changes across AWS resources. While this service can be used for patch management, it may not provide the same level of centralized control as Patch Manager. Option (D) does not provide a centralized or automated way to manage patches and may not ensure that all affected instances are updated in a timely manner.
