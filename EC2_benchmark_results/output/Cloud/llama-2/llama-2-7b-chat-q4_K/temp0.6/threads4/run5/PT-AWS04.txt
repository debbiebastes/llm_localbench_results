Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The maximum number of EC2 instances that you can launch to achieve optimal performance is (B) 12.
Explanation:
When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards is increased by splitting the existing shards into smaller groups. To achieve optimum performance, you should have an equal number of EC2 instances working on each shard. Therefore, to process six open shards, you would need at least 6 EC2 instances (1 for each shard).
In this case, launching 12 EC2 instances provides the maximum possible number of instances that can be used to process the increased number of open shards. Launching more than 12 instances may not provide significant performance improvements and may incur unnecessary costs.
