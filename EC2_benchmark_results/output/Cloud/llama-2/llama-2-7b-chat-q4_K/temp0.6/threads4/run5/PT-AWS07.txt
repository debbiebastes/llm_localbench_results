A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution would be option (C): Configuring a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day. This approach allows you to proactively launch additional instances before the morning rush, ensuring that the application has enough resources to handle the increased traffic at the beginning of the day.
A scheduled scaling policy allows you to define a schedule for when and how many instances should be launched or terminated. By setting up a schedule that launches new instances before office hours, you can ensure that the application has enough capacity to handle the expected traffic without any slowdowns or performance issues.
Option (C) provides the most efficient solution because it allows you to proactively address the issue by launching additional instances before the start of the day, rather than reacting to user complaints later in the day. Options (A), (B), and (D) do not provide a direct solution to the problem and may require more complex configurations or monitoring to achieve the desired results.
