A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B) The endpoint request timed-out.

When a Lambda function is invoked through an API Gateway, the invocation is asynchronous and can take some time to complete. If the request takes too long to process, the API Gateway will return a 502 Bad Gateway error. In this case, it's likely that the Lambda function took longer than expected to execute, causing the API Gateway to timeout.
Option (B) is the best answer because it accurately describes the issue and is consistent with the symptoms described in the question. Options (A), (C), and (D) do not match the information provided in the question.
