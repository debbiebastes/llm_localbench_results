The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (C): Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Why?
AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides a simple way to manage patching across multiple EC2 instances, including those with old operating systems. By using Patch Manager, you can easily deploy OS patches to the outdated EC2 instances without having to manually update each instance individually. This approach also reduces the risk of human error and ensures consistency in patch management across all instances.
AWS Config provides a centralized inventory of AWS resources that can be used to track changes to the configuration of those resources over time. By integrating AWS Config with Patch Manager, you can record and track any configuration changes associated with the patching process, which is important for audit purposes.
Option (A) may not be the best solution because it involves using Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track configuration changes, which may add unnecessary complexity to the solution. Option (B) may also not be the most suitable choice because it requires setting up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager separately from AWS Config, which could lead to confusion and duplication of effort. Option (D) is not a feasible solution as it does not provide a centralized management console for patching multiple EC2 instances.
