A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

The most cost-effective option would be (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
Explanation:
If the application being hosted will be used for more than 3 years, it is more cost-effective to purchase a 3-year Reserved Instance instead of a 1-year Reserved Instance and renewing it every year. The All Upfront pricing option offers the best discount compared to other pricing options.
Option (A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term is not the most cost-effective option because it only provides a discount of 75% compared to On-Demand pricing, whereas Option (C) offers a 64% discount.
Option (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term is not cost-effective because it does not provide any upfront discount, and the pricing is more expensive than the All Upfront pricing option.
Option (D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year is also not cost-effective because it does not offer any upfront discount, and the pricing increases over time as the instance is renewed.
