(D) Platform Perspective

Answer: 
(C) Operations Perspective

Explanation:
The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) provides a systematic approach to migrating workloads to the cloud. Of the available options, the Operations Perspective is most relevant for e-commerce companies migrating on-premise infrastructure to AWS.
The Operations Perspective focuses on ensuring that the migration is executed smoothly and efficiently, with minimal disruption to business operations. It involves identifying and addressing any potential issues or risks associated with the migration, such as data transfer, application compatibility, and performance concerns.
By focusing on the Operations Perspective, the e-commerce company can ensure that their migration is not only secure but also streamlined and efficient, minimizing downtime and maximizing productivity during the transition.
