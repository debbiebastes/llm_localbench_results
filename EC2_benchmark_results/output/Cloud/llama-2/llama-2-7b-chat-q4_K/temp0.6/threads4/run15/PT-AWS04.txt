Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) 12.

Explanation: When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards is increased proportionally to the number of instances running the KCL worker. In this case, you have 6 open shards after resharding, which means that each instance can handle 1/6 of the data volume. To achieve optimum performance, you should launch enough EC2 instances to match the number of open shards. Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch is 6.
Note: This answer assumes that the KCL worker is running at full capacity and can handle the entire data volume for each shard without any bottlenecks or other performance issues. In practice, you may need to adjust the number of instances based on additional factors such as network latency, instance type, and data volume size.
