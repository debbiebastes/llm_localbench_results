The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (C): Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
In this scenario, the IT Security team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk by patching the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The best solution is to use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, which can easily deploy OS patches for outdated EC2 instances. This tool provides a centralized and automated way to manage patching across multiple EC2 instances, ensuring that all instances are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
Additionally, it is important to record any configuration changes made as part of the patching process. AWS Config provides a centralized logging service that can be used to track and record any changes made to the configuration of EC2 instances, including changes made as part of the patching process. This will help ensure compliance with auditing requirements and provide a historical record of any changes made to the environment.
Option (A) uses Systems Manager Sessions Manager, which is not suitable for deploying OS patches on a large scale. Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, but does not provide a way to record configuration changes. Option (D) configures weekly automatic patching, which may not be sufficient in addressing the immediate security risk.
