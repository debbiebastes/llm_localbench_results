An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
An EBS volume provides persistent block storage, which meets the requirement of a mission-critical workload. Amazon S3 is recommended for storing backup data as it provides scalable and durable storage. By attaching an EBS volume in your EC2 instance, you can ensure that your data remains available even if your instance is terminated or stopped.
To transition your backup data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, you can configure a lifecycle policy on your S3 bucket. This will automatically move your objects from S3 Standard storage to S3 Glacier after the specified time period. Amazon S3 Glacier provides long-term archival storage with lower costs compared to S3 Standard storage.
Therefore, option (B) is the best answer.
