An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (A): Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance, and use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
Instance store volumes are faster than EBS volumes and provide better performance for read-heavy workloads. They are also more expensive than EBS volumes. In this case, since the organization needs a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, attaching an instance store volume in the existing EC2 instance is the best option.
Storing the backup data in Amazon S3 provides a scalable and durable storage solution that can handle large amounts of data. Configure a lifecycle policy to transition the objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which will provide long-term archiving at a lower cost. Amazon S3 Glacier is designed for storing large quantities of data and provides low-cost, high-capacity storage for archival data.
In summary, attaching an instance store volume in the existing EC2 instance and using Amazon S3 to store the backup data with a lifecycle policy that transitions the objects to Amazon S3 Glacier meets the organization's requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads while also providing long-term archiving at a lower cost.
