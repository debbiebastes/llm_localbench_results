The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
Option (A) provides a comprehensive solution to address both the immediate security risk and the need for audit compliance. By deploying OS patches using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, the team can quickly and securely apply the necessary updates to the outdated EC2 instances. Additionally, integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana provides a centralized platform for tracking and monitoring all configuration changes, ensuring compliance with audit requirements.
Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy patches, but this solution does not provide real-time tracking and monitoring of configuration changes. Option (C) uses AWS Config to record and track configuration changes, but this solution does not address the immediate security risk. Option (D) configures EC2 instances to automatically install OS patches on a weekly basis, but this approach may not be sufficient for urgent security vulnerabilities.
In summary, option (A) is the most suitable solution as it provides a comprehensive and timely approach to addressing the security risk and meeting audit compliance requirements.
