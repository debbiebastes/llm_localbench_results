A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B) The endpoint request timed-out. When a Lambda function is used as an integration backend for an AWS API Gateway, any outgoing requests from the Lambda function have a default timeout of 10 seconds. If no response is received within that time frame, the Lambda function will return a 502 Bad Gateway error to the client.
In this scenario, it's likely that the underlying Lambda function took longer than 10 seconds to complete its execution, causing the API gateway to timeout and return a 502 error.
