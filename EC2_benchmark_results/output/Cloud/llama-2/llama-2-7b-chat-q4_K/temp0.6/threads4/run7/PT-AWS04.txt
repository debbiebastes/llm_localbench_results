Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The optimal number of EC2 instances for your application depends on various factors, including the volume and complexity of data being processed, the processing power required to handle the workload, and the available resources in your AWS environment. In this scenario, the Kinesis stream has four shards, each with one KCL worker. To achieve optimal performance, you should launch additional EC2 instances to match the number of shards in your Kinesis stream. Therefore, the answer is (C) 3.
