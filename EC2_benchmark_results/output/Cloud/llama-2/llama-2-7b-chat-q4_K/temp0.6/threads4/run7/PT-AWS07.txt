A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution is (C): Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
Explanation: The issue at hand is that the application is slow during the early morning hours, which indicates that there may not be enough instances available to handle the traffic. By configuring a scheduled scaling policy, you can automatically launch additional instances before the start of the day, ensuring that there are enough resources available to handle the traffic from the moment the users log in. This will prevent any performance issues and ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day.
Option (A) is incorrect because predictive scaling policies rely on historical data to forecast future usage, which may not accurately reflect the current workload. Option (B) is also incorrect because dynamic scaling policies adjust instances based on real-time metrics, which may not provide enough lead time to launch new instances before the start of the day. Option (D) is incorrect because CPU utilization may not be the best metric to use for scaling, as it does not necessarily reflect the workload on the instances.
