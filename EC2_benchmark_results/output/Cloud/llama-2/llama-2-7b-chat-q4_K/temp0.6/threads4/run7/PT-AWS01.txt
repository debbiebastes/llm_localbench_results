A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.
Explanation:
As per the question, the sensitive PII of patients should never be sent to AWS, and therefore, server-side encryption options are not feasible. Client-side encryption is the only option left, which can be implemented using Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach ensures that the master keys are managed by the client (hospital), and never sent to AWS, thereby meeting the compliance requirements.
Option (A) is incorrect because it involves client-side encryption with a client-side master key, which may not meet regulatory requirements as the hospital cannot manage the master keys directly. Option (C) is also incorrect because server-side encryption requires the hospital to provide AWS with the encrypted data, which violates compliance and regulatory requirements. Option (D) is incorrect because it involves using a customer-provided key, which may not be secure or auditable.
