A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements is option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, and set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
Here's why:
Option A is not ideal because DynamoDB Accelerator does not provide the necessary features for auditing and logging. It only provides performance optimization and caching capabilities.
Option B is also not ideal because Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) is a feature that allows you to restore DynamoDB tables to a specific point in time, but it does not provide real-time event tracking or auditing capabilities.
Option D is also not ideal because DynamoDB Streams are designed to handle high-volume, high-throughput streaming data, whereas the scenario requires a more controlled and structured approach for auditing changes made to DynamoDB tables.
By using Amazon EventBridge with Lambda functions, you can set up real-time event tracking and auditing of changes made to DynamoDB tables in another region. Each time an event occurs in one of the tables, the EventBridge rule will trigger a Lambda function to process and save the new changes to the other table. This approach provides a structured and controlled way to comply with IT compliance requirements while also providing real-time auditing capabilities.
