The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (B): Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
Explanation:
AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides a simple and automated way to manage patching for EC2 instances, including those with outdated operating systems. It allows you to easily deploy patches and updates to your EC2 instances, without having to manually configure or schedule the patches. Additionally, AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager integrates with Amazon ES (Elasticsearch Service), which provides a scalable and flexible search and analytics service that can be used to record and track any configuration changes made to the EC2 instances.
Option (A) is not the most suitable solution because it involves deploying patches using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, which may not be as efficient or automated as Patch Manager. Option (C) is also not the best choice because while AWS Config can record and track configuration changes, it does not provide a simple way to deploy patches to EC2 instances.
Option (D) is not a feasible solution because automatic patch installation on a weekly basis may not be feasible or practical for all organizations, especially those with complex systems or custom applications that require more frequent patching.
