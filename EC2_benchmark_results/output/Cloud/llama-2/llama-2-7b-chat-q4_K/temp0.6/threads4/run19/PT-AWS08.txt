An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
An EBS volume provides block-level storage for an EC2 instance, and it is ideal for storing mission-critical data. By attaching an EBS volume to the EC2 instance, you can ensure that the data is persisted even if the instance fails or is terminated.
Using Amazon S3 to store your backup data is a good choice because it provides a scalable, durable, and secure storage solution. You can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which will help you save storage costs and optimize performance.
Option (A) is not the best choice because instance store volumes are attached to the EC2 instance itself, and they do not provide persistence outside of the instance. If the instance fails or is terminated, the data on an instance store volume will be lost.
Option (C) is also not the best choice because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA does not provide a cost-effective solution for long-term archiving. While it can help you reduce latency and improve performance, it may not be the most cost-effective option for storing data that will be accessed only once in 30 days.
Option (D) is also not the best choice because instance store volumes are attached to the EC2 instance itself, and they do not provide persistence outside of the instance. If the instance fails or is terminated, the data on an instance store volume will be lost.
