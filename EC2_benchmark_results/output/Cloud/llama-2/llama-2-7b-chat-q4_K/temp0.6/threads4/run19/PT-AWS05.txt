A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The best answer is (C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
This approach provides the following benefits:

* It does not require any additional infrastructure, such as DynamoDB Accelerator or Point-in-Time Recovery, which can add complexity and cost to the system.
* It uses CloudWatch Events, which is a fully managed service that allows you to track events in your AWS resources, including DynamoDB tables. This means that you do not need to manually configure and maintain any additional infrastructure.
* It provides a flexible and scalable solution, as you can easily add new Lambda functions or CloudWatch Events rules as needed to handle different types of changes.
* It integrates well with the existing serverless architecture, allowing you to leverage the benefits of a serverless system while still meeting the IT compliance requirements.
