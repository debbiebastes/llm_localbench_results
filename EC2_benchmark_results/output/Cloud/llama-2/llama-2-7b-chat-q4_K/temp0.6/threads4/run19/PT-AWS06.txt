A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

When a Lambda function returns an HTTP response, it must be in the form of JSON or XML. If the function returns any other format, such as plain text or binary data, the Amazon API Gateway will not be able to parse and process the response properly, resulting in a 502 Bad Gateway error.
Therefore, the developer should check if the Lambda function is returning an incompatible output when it is being invoked through the Amazon API Gateway proxy integration, and fix the issue accordingly.
