Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched to achieve optimum performance is option (B) 12.
Explanation:
When you reshard your Kinesis data stream to increase the number of open shards from four to six, it means that you have increased the parallelism in your application. This allows more instances to process the data in parallel, which can lead to improved performance.
To achieve optimum performance, you need to launch enough EC2 instances to match the new level of parallelism. In this case, since you have increased the number of open shards by 50% (from 4 to 6), you should launch at least 50% more EC2 instances, which is option (B) 12.
Option (A) 5 is too few instances, as it will not be able to handle the increased parallelism due to the resharding of the stream. Option (C) 3 is also too few instances, as it will not be able to handle the additional load from the increased parallelism. Option (D) 6 is incorrect, as you are increasing the number of open shards by 50%, not decreasing it.
