A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The most efficient way to remediate this security risk would be option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and then associate an Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
AWS Config allows you to define rules that specify whether resources should be created or updated based on certain conditions. In this case, the rule would detect when a security group allows traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This would ensure that all traffic to and from the EC2 instances is routed through the corporate firewall, which can help prevent unauthorized access and improve security.
Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances, but does not address the issue of allowing inbound traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, but this would not remediate the security risk and would only block traffic to the EC2 instances. Option (D) uses AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but does not provide a way to automatically update the security groups with the corporate firewall IP address.
