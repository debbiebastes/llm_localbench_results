Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The optimal number of EC2 instances to launch for your application can be determined by analyzing the data processing requirements and performance metrics. However, as a rule of thumb, you can start with the following assumptions:

* For a single shard stream with four KCL workers, each instance can handle approximately 1/4 of the total throughput.
* For a resharded stream with six shards and four KCL workers per instance, each instance can handle approximately 1/6 of the total throughput.

Based on these assumptions, you should launch at least 6 EC2 instances to achieve optimum performance (Option D). This will allow each instance to handle approximately 1/6 of the total throughput, resulting in a more balanced workload and better overall performance.

Note that this is just a rough estimate, and you may need to adjust the number of instances based on your specific application requirements and performance metrics.
