A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

Reasoning:
API Gateway is designed to handle high traffic and can automatically scale to meet the needs of your application. By enabling throttling limits, you can control the number of requests that are allowed to reach the backend service during peak hours, preventing overload and ensuring a stable and responsive user experience. Additionally, result caching in API Gateway allows you to store the results of previous requests, reducing the load on the backend service and improving response times.
Option (A) is not the best choice because while EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling can provide a more scalable architecture, they may not be necessary for this scenario as API Gateway can already handle high traffic. Option (C) is also not the best choice as CloudFront is designed to cache content at edge locations closer to end-users, but it does not provide the same level of throttling and caching capabilities as API Gateway. Option (D) is also not the best choice because moving a Lambda function to a VPC may not be necessary for this scenario.
