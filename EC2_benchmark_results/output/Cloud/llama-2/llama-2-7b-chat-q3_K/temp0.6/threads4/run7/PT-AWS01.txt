A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:
Amazon S3 supports two types of encryption: server-side encryption and client-side encryption. Client-side encryption is more secure as it doesn't rely on AWS to manage the encryption keys, which reduces the risk of unauthorized access to the encrypted data.
With client-side encryption, Amazon S3 provides a customer master key (CMK) that is managed by the user, and this CMK is used to encrypt data stored in S3. The CMK is never sent to AWS, which ensures that the sensitive information remains secure.
Option (A) is incorrect because client-side encryption with a client-side master key doesn't provide the same level of security as using a KMS-managed customer master key. Option (C) is also incorrect because server-side encryption does not provide the same level of control over the encryption keys as client-side encryption.
Option (D) is incorrect because it is not possible to use a customer provided key for encryption in Amazon S3.
