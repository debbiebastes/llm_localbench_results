A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements is option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
Here's why:

1. Cost-effective: Using Amazon EventBridge (formerly known as AWS CloudWatch Events) is a cost-effective solution as it doesn't require any additional infrastructure or services.
2. Scalable: Amazon EventBridge can handle large volumes of events and scale to meet the needs of your application.
3. Flexible: You can configure the rule to trigger Lambda functions based on various events, such as table-level changes, item updates, or even data expiration.
4. Easy to set up: Setting up an Amazon EventBridge rule is relatively straightforward and doesn't require extensive knowledge of AWS services.
5. Integrated with other AWS services: Amazon EventBridge integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3, making it a convenient choice for this use case.
In summary, creating an Amazon EventBridge rule to track table-level events in DynamoDB is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements while ensuring cost-effectiveness, scalability, flexibility, ease of setup, and integration with other AWS services.
