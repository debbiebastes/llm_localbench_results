A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

The most cost-effective option would be (C): All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:
Reserved Instances provide a discount on EC2 instances in exchange for a fixed upfront payment and a commitment to use the instance for a certain period of time. The cost savings from using Reserved Instances can be significant, especially for applications that are used for more than 1 year.
Option (A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term would provide the least cost savings since it only offers a discount on the first year of usage and does not provide any long-term commitment or cost savings.
Option (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term would also provide limited cost savings since there is no upfront payment required, but the discounts are only available for the first year of usage.
Option (D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year would provide some cost savings over On-Demand pricing, but the upfront payment would need to be made each year, which could result in higher overall costs over a 3-year period.
Therefore, option (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term is the most cost-effective option for an application that will be used for more than 3 years.
