A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements is option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, and set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
Here's why:

1. EventBridge is a fully managed service that allows you to route events from multiple sources (including DynamoDB) to Lambda functions or other AWS services. This means that you can easily set up an event rule in EventBride that listens for table-level events in DynamoDB, such as "PutItem" and "DeleteItem".
2. By using EventBridge, you don't have to worry about manually configuring DynamoDB streams or creating a custom workflow to handle the data movement between tables. This makes it easier to set up and manage your serverless application.
3. Lambda functions can be easily integrated with EventBridge to process and save new changes to the other table in another region. This allows you to maintain a consistent data replication mechanism across different regions without incurring additional costs or complexity.
4. By using Lambda functions as rule targets, you can also apply business logic or automation to handle the data movement between tables, ensuring that the data is properly processed and formatted before it's written to the new table.
In summary, option (C) provides the most ideal solution for complying with the requirements by leveraging EventBridge and Lambda functions to track and process changes in DynamoDB across different regions.
