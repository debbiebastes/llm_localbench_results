A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution to implement is (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
Scheduled scaling allows you to specify a schedule for when instances should be launched or terminated, allowing you to ensure that there are enough instances running during peak usage times. This can help ensure that the application is available and performant at the beginning of the day, without relying on predictive or dynamic scaling policies that may not take into account unforeseen changes in usage patterns.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances is not the most operationally efficient solution as it relies on machine learning algorithms to predict future usage patterns, which may not always be accurate.
Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization is not the most operationally efficient solution as it does not take into account other factors that can affect application performance, such as CPU utilization or network latency.
Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization is also not the most operationally efficient solution as it may cause unnecessary instance launches if CPU usage is not consistently high throughout the day.
