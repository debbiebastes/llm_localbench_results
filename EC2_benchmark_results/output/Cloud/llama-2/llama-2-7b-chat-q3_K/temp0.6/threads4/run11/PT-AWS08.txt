An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
To meet the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, you should choose option (C): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.
Option (A) is not a good choice because instance store volumes are ephemeral and cannot be used for mission-critical workloads that require persistence.
Option (B) is also not a good choice because EBS volumes are not designed to store unstructured data like backups, and they may not provide the necessary performance or durability requirements for your workloads.
Option (D) is not a valid choice because instance store volumes are not available in all Amazon EC2 regions.
By choosing option (C), you can use EBS volumes to store your backup data persistently and ensure that it is available even after 30 days, which meets the requirement for mission-critical workloads.
