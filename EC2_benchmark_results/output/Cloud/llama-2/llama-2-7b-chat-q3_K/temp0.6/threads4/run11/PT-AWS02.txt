The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
Reasoning:
AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager is a fully managed service that makes it easy to manage patches across your Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon RDS instances, and other AWS resources. It provides a centralized platform for deploying patches, which can help mitigate the security risk posed by outdated operating systems.
Moreover, using Amazon ES (Elastic Search) to record and track any configuration changes is an excellent way to maintain compliance audit trails. Amazon ES is a fully managed search service that makes it easy to store, index, and manage data in a scalable, secure manner. It can be used to track changes made to the AWS resources, including patches deployed using Patch Manager.
While options (A) and (C) also provide viable solutions, they are not as straightforward or efficient as option (B) in addressing the security risk posed by outdated operating systems. Option (D) is not a feasible solution because it does not provide a centralized platform for managing patches across multiple EC2 instances.
