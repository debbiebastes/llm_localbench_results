A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The most efficient way to remediate this security risk would be option (A): Using AWS Config rules to automatically detect and update the security group. Here's why:

Option (A) uses AWS Config, a service that allows you to manage and track configuration changes across your AWS environment. By setting up an AWS Config rule, you can automatically detect any security groups that allow inbound TCP or UDP traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Once detected, you can associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is efficient because it automates the remediation process without requiring manual intervention or the use of other services like Network ACLs or AWS Shield.
Options (B) and (C) are not as efficient for several reasons:
Option (B) requires setting up a Transit VPC, which can be complex and time-consuming. It also doesn't address the root cause of the security risk, which is the lack of approval for adding rules to security groups.
Option (C) uses Network ACLs to block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. While this can help mitigate the security risk, it doesn't address the underlying issue of unapproved changes to security groups.
Option (D) uses AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. While this can help detect potential security risks, it doesn't provide a solution for remediating the issue automatically.
In summary, option (A) is the most efficient way to automate the remediation of unapproved changes to security groups, as it leverages AWS Config rules and Systems Manager Automation to streamline the process without requiring manual intervention or additional services like Network ACLs or AWS Shield.
