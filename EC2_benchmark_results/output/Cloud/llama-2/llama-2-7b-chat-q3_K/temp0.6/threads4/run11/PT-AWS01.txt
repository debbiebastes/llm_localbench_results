A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:
Amazon S3 provides two types of encryption: server-side encryption and client-side encryption. Server-side encryption encrypts data at rest, while client-side encryption encrypts data in transit. In this case, the Security Engineer should use client-side encryption to ensure that the sensitive PII data is encrypted before it is stored in Amazon S3.
To comply with regulatory requirements, the master key used for encryption must be managed by KMS (Key Management Service). Therefore, option (B) is the best choice as it involves using a KMS-managed customer master key for client-side encryption.
Option (A) is incorrect because Amazon S3 provides client-side encryption with a client-side master key, which can lead to data breaches if the master key is compromised.
Option (C) is also incorrect because server-side encryption does not provide the necessary security controls for sensitive PII data.
Option (D) is incorrect because Amazon S3 does not support customer-provided keys for client-side encryption.
