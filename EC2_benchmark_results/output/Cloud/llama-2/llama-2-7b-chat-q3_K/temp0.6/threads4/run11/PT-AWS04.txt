Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation: When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards must match the number of EC2 instances used to process the stream. In this case, the original configuration had four shards and four EC2 instances, so doubling the number of shards means that six EC2 instances are required to achieve optimum performance.
