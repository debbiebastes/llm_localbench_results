A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements would be option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
EventBridge is a fully managed service that allows you to route AWS CloudWatch events to a Lambda function, Amazon Kinesis stream, or an S3 bucket. In this scenario, the EventBridge rule can be set up to track table-level events in DynamoDB (such as item creation, update, or deletion) and trigger a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table in another region.
This approach allows for a fully automated and scalable solution that does not require manual intervention or additional infrastructure, such as DynamoDB Accelerator or Point-in-Time Recovery. Additionally, it allows you to easily monitor and manage the data syncs between the two tables using CloudWatch events and Lambda functions.
