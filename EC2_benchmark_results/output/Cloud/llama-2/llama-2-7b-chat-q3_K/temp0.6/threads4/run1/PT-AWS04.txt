Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched for optimum performance is option (D) 6.

Reasoning:
As you have mentioned in the question, your application is currently processing one Kinesis data stream with four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you resharded your stream to increase the number of open shards to six. This means that each shard will be processed by two EC2 instances (one KCL worker per instance). Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched for optimum performance is six.
Option (A) 5 is incorrect because it is lower than the actual number of shards you resharded your stream to. Option (B) 12 is also incorrect because it is higher than the actual number of shards you resharded your stream to. Option (C) 3 is incorrect because it is lower than the actual number of EC2 instances that can be launched for optimum performance.
