A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:
According to the question, the sensitive PII of patients should never be sent to AWS. Client-side encryption is a technique where data is encrypted on the client's side before it is uploaded to S3, ensuring that the data remains encrypted throughout its journey from the client to AWS. By using a KMS-managed customer master key for client-side encryption, the security engineer can maintain control over the encryption keys without ever sending them to AWS. This approach meets the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company while also ensuring that the sensitive PII is properly protected.
