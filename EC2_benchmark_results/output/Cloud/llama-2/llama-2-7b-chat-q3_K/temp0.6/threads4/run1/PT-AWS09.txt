A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

By enabling throttling limits, you can control the rate of requests that are allowed to hit your backend systems, preventing them from getting overwhelmed by an influx of traffic. This can help protect against downtime or other issues caused by an unexpected spike in traffic.
Result caching in API Gateway allows you to cache the results of API calls, reducing the load on the backend systems and ensuring that users get faster responses even during a traffic surge. This can help prevent the platform from crashing due to an influx of requests.
While options (A) and (C) may provide more scalability and availability, they are not directly related to protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes. Option (D) moving the Lambda function in a VPC is also not relevant to this scenario as it does not address the issue of traffic management.
