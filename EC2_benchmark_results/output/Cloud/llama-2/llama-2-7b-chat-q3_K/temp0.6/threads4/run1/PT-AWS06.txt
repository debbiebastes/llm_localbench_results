A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B): The endpoint request timed-out. When a Lambda function is invoked via an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration, the underlying function may take longer than expected to complete its execution. If the response from the function does not return within a certain time frame (known as the timeout), the API gateway will return a 502 Bad Gateway error. This can be caused by the underlying Lambda function taking too long to execute or due to delays in the network communication between the API Gateway and the Lambda function.
