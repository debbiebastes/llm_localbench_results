A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Here's why:
Option (A) uses AWS Config rules to detect whether there are any security groups that allow traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which is the source of the security risk. Once the detection occurs, the AWS Lambda function associated with the AWS Config rule can automatically remediate the issue by updating the security group to allow traffic only from the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is efficient because it automates the remediation process without requiring manual intervention or additional infrastructure.
Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances, which may not be necessary in this scenario as the security risk is related to security groups rather than network topology.
Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, which does not address the root cause of the security issue and may introduce additional complexity in the network configuration.
Option (D) uses AWS Shield to monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but it does not provide automated remediation capabilities like option (A).
