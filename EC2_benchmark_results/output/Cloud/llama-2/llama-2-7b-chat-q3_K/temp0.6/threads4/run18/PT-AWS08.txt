An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
An EBS volume is a block storage volume that provides persistent storage for EC2 instances. It will provide the required persistency for mission-critical workloads. Amazon S3 provides a scalable, durable, and secure object storage service where you can store your backup data. By configuring a lifecycle policy in Amazon S3, you can transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which is a cold storage tier that provides long-term archiving at a lower cost than Amazon S3 standard storage.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not available for EC2 instances launched in the US East region, and option (D) is incorrect because it refers to One Zone-IA instead of Glacier.
