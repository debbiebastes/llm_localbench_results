A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The most likely root cause of this issue is option (B): The endpoint request timed-out.

When a Lambda function is invoked through an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration, the underlying function will return its output in response to the API call. However, if the request takes too long to process or complete, the API Gateway may timeout and return a 502 Bad Gateway error to the client. In this case, option (B) is the most likely root cause of the issue, as the endpoint request timed-out before the underlying function could return its output.
