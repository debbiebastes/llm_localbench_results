Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)

Explanation:
AWS EventBridge (formerly known as AWS CloudWatch Events) is a service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It allows you to connect various AWS services, APIs, and custom applications through events, enabling you to create a scalable and flexible event-driven architecture.
AWS EventBridge provides a centralized platform for managing and routing events from multiple sources, including AWS services like S3, EC2, and DynamoDB, as well as external sources like HTTP endpoints, databases, and custom applications. By decoupling the components of your application using events, you can improve the scalability, reliability, and maintainability of your application.
In contrast, Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queue service that enables you to decouple components of an application by sending messages between them, but it does not provide the same level of flexibility as EventBridge in terms of event management and routing. Amazon SNS (Serverless Application Model) is a serverless messaging service that provides a managed service for building scalable application infrastructure, but it does not support event-driven architecture like EventBridge does. Amazon Kinesis is a fully managed streaming service that enables you to process and analyze real-time, streaming data, but it does not provide the same level of flexibility as EventBridge in terms of managing and routing events from multiple sources.
