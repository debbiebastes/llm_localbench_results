The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (B): Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
Here's why:
AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides a simple and efficient way to manage patches across multiple EC2 instances. It can automatically detect and apply security patches, as well as generate reports on the status of patch management activities. By using Patch Manager, the IT Security team can ensure that all EC2 instances are up-to-date with the latest security patches in a timely manner.
Additionally, Amazon ES (Elasticsearch Service) provides a highly scalable and flexible data storage solution for recording and tracking configuration changes. By integrating Amazon ES with Patch Manager, the IT Security team can easily track and monitor all configuration changes across the EC2 instances, ensuring compliance with security standards and regulatory requirements.
Option (A) is not suitable because it involves using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, which is a lower-level service that does not provide the same level of automation and control as Patch Manager.
Option (C) is also not suitable because while AWS Config can monitor and track configuration changes, it does not provide the same level of automation and control as Patch Manager when it comes to deploying patches across multiple EC2 instances.
Option (D) is not a viable solution because automatic installation of patches on a weekly basis may not be enough to address immediate security risks or meet compliance requirements.
