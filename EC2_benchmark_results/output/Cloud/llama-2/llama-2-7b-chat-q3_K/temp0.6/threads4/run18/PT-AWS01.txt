A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The Security Engineer should implement Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key to meet the company's compliance and regulatory requirements. This is because:

* Client-side encryption means that sensitive data remains encrypted on the client side, even when stored in AWS S3.
* A KMS-managed customer master key provides an additional layer of security and control over the encryption process. The Security Engineer can manage the encryption keys using AWS Key Management Service (KMS), ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data.
In contrast, option (A) would not provide adequate protection as client-side master keys could be compromised or exposed, leading to potential security breaches. Option (C) is also not feasible as server-side encryption does not provide the same level of control over encryption keys. Option (D) is incorrect because customer provided keys are not managed by AWS KMS and do not provide the necessary security controls for compliance reasons.
