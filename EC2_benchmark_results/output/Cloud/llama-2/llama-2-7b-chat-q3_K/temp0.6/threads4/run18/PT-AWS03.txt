A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. This approach uses AWS Config to monitor the security groups for unauthorized access and remediate by updating the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Option (A) is the most efficient because it leverages AWS Config, which is a managed service that provides a way to manage and automate configuration of AWS resources. Using AWS Config, you can easily detect changes in the security groups and apply remediation actions automatically, without requiring manual intervention or additional infrastructure.
Option (B) would require setting up a Transit VPC, which adds complexity and cost to the solution. Option (C) would block traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but it would not remediate the security risk by updating the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. Option (D) is not a feasible option as AWS Shield is not designed to monitor and detect security groups.
