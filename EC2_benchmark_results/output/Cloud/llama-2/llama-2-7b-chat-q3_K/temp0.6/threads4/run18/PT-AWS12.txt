A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The most cost-effective option would be (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:

Reserved Instances offer several pricing options, including Convertible Reserved Instances and Standard Reserved Instances. The difference between the two is that Convertible Reserved Instances allow you to convert the reservation to an On-Demand instance at any time during the term of the reservation, while Standard Reserved Instances do not allow for this flexibility.
For a 3-year term, the most cost-effective option would be to choose the All Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing. This option provides the best value over the long term because you pay a lower hourly rate upfront and avoid any instance usage charges. Additionally, choosing this option locks in the price of the EC2 instance for the entire 3-year term, providing predictability and budgeting stability for your application hosting costs.
Option (A), All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term, is less cost-effective because the reservation term is shorter, and you may end up paying more over the course of the year due to instance usage charges. Option (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term is not a viable option as it does not provide any pricing discounts or incentives for committing to a longer reservation term.
