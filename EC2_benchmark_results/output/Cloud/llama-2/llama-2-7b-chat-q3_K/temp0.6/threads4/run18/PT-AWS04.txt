Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

The maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched for optimal performance is (D) 6. The current setup has four shards per instance, and increasing the number of open shards to six will allow for better distribution of data processing across multiple instances, leading to improved performance. Therefore, launching up to six EC2 instances will provide optimum performance for your application.
