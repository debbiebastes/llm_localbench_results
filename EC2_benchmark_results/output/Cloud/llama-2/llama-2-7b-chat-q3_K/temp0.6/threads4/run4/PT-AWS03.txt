A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The most efficient way to remediate this security risk would be option (A): Using AWS Config rules to automatically detect and update security groups that allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Here's why:

1. Automation: Using AWS Config rules, you can automate the process of detecting and updating security groups that allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. This eliminates the need for manual intervention and reduces the risk of human error.
2. Scalability: With AWS Config, you can easily scale the remediation process to handle multiple security groups across your organization.
3. Accuracy: AWS Config provides accurate inventory management of security groups in your AWS account, ensuring that only authorized IP addresses are allowed to access your resources.
4. Security: By using AWS Config, you can ensure that security groups are updated with the corporate firewall IP address, which improves overall security posture and reduces risk.
5. Cost-effective: Using AWS Config is a cost-effective solution as it eliminates the need for manual intervention, reducing labor costs associated with manually updating security groups.
6. Integration: AWS Config can be integrated with other AWS services such as AWS Shield to provide additional monitoring and detection capabilities.
7. Flexibility: With AWS Config, you can remediate security groups in a flexible and efficient manner, without disrupting your development workflow.
8. Monitoring: AWS Config provides real-time monitoring of security groups, allowing you to quickly identify and address any security issues before they become critical.
9. Continuous Compliance: With AWS Config, you can ensure continuous compliance with security policies and industry standards, reducing the risk of security breaches.
10. Auditing: AWS Config provides detailed audit logs of all changes made to security groups, allowing you to track and analyze security updates over time.

In summary, option (A) is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk due to its automation capabilities, scalability, accuracy, security benefits, cost-effectiveness, flexibility, monitoring, continuous compliance, and auditing features.
