A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

API Gateway is an elegant and scalable architecture that allows you to handle traffic spikes without the need for significant infrastructure changes or upgrades. You can configure throttling limits to control the number of requests that a user can make within a certain time frame, preventing overload and ensuring that your backend systems remain stable under pressure. Additionally, API Gateway provides caching capabilities, allowing you to store frequently accessed data in a cache for faster retrieval, further reducing the load on your backend systems. This approach enables you to enjoy the benefits of scalability and high availability without having to make significant changes to your existing architecture.
