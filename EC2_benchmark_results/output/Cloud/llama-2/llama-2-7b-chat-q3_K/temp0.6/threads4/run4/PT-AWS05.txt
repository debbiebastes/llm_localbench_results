A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements would be option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
Here's why:
EventBridge is a fully managed service that allows you to react to changes in AWS services, including DynamoDB. By creating an EventBridge rule that tracks events on the original table, you can automatically capture any new changes made to items in that table. You can then use a Lambda function as a target for this rule to process and save these changes to the other table in another region.
Setting up DynamoDB Accelerator (option A) would not provide the desired functionality of capturing changes made to the original table, as it only provides performance improvements for reads and writes. Enabling DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery (option B) is also not ideal, as it would require manual intervention to create a point-in-time recovery snapshot, and it may not capture all of the changes made to the original table.
Option D is also not the best choice, as DynamoDB Streams are intended for real-time streaming of data from DynamoDB tables, rather than capturing changes to items in a table over time.
