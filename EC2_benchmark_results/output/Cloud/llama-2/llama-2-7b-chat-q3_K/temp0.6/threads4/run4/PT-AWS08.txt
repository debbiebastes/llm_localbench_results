An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
To meet the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, option (C) is the best choice.

Option (C) specifies using an EBS volume in the EC2 instance, which provides persistent block storage for data that requires high availability and durability. Amazon S3 can be used to store the backup data, and a lifecycle policy can be configured to transition objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA after 30 days.
Option (A) uses instance store volumes, which are not recommended for mission-critical workloads as they do not provide persistent storage and are only available within the availability zone.
Option (B) uses EBS volumes, but does not specify that they are persistent, so it may not meet the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume.
Option (D) specifies using an instance store volume, which is not recommended for mission-critical workloads as it does not provide persistent storage and is only available within the availability zone.
