A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution would be (C) Configuring a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day. This will ensure that the application has enough instances available at the beginning of the day, when users are most likely to be using it, and reduce the performance issues caused by insufficient instance capacity.
A scheduled scaling policy allows you to specify a schedule for scaling your Auto Scaling group, so you can configure it to launch new instances at a specific time each day, such as 30 minutes before the start of office hours. This will give the instances enough time to spin up and be available for user requests when the application is in high demand.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy is not the best choice because it relies on predicting usage patterns, which can be difficult to accurately predict, especially for a complex application like a CRM system. Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on Memory utilization may also not be the best choice as memory utilization may not always be the best indicator of performance issues, and it may lead to overprovisioning of instances during periods of low usage. Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on CPU utilization is also not the best choice as CPU utilization may not always be the best indicator of performance issues, especially if the application is multi-threaded and can utilize multiple CPU cores.
