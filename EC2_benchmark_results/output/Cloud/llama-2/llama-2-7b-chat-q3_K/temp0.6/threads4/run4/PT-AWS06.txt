A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The most likely root cause of this issue is (B) The endpoint request timed-out. When using Amazon API Gateway, it's important to ensure that requests are processed within a reasonable time frame, as otherwise, the gateway may return a 502 Bad Gateway error. In this case, the developer may have accidentally set a longer timeout for the underlying Lambda function, causing the proxy integration to fail. To troubleshoot this issue, the developer can check the timeout settings in the Amazon API Gateway console and adjust them accordingly.
