An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:
An EBS volume provides persistent block storage for EC2 instances, which is suitable for mission-critical workloads. By attaching an EBS volume in the EC2 instance, you can store your backup data securely and persistently. Amazon S3 provides a highly durable and scalable object storage service that can be used to store your backup data.
To transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier, you can create a lifecycle policy that moves objects from Amazon S3 to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. This will ensure that your backup data is stored in a cost-effective and durable storage solution while still maintaining the flexibility of accessing it as needed.
Option (A) does not provide persistent storage for EC2 instances, whereas option (C) does not support lifecycle policies for transitioning objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA. Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are ephemeral and do not provide persistent storage.
