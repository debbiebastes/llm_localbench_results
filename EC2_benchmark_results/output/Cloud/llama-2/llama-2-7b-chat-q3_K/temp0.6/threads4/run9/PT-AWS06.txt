A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The most likely root cause of this issue is (B) The endpoint request timed-out. When a Lambda function is invoked through an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration, the underlying function may not always respond within a reasonable time period. As a result, the API Gateway may return a 502 Bad Gateway error to indicate that it waited too long for a response from the Lambda function. In this case, the developer should check the timeout settings in the API Gateway and adjust them as necessary to prevent this error from occurring.
