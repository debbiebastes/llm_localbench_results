A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
In this scenario, option (B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway is the best solution to protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes.
API Gateway can be configured to limit the number of requests that can be made to a Lambda function within a certain time period, preventing overload on the system. Additionally, API Gateway has a built-in caching feature that allows you to cache the results of a Lambda function, reducing the load on the backend systems.
Option (A) switching to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling is not necessary in this scenario as API Gateway is already built with scalability in mind and can handle increased traffic without the need for additional infrastructure.
Option (C) Using CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache is not recommended as it would not provide the same level of protection as throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway, and would also increase latency for users.
Option (D) Moving the Lambda function in a VPC is not relevant to this scenario as the Lambda function is already deployed in a cloud environment.
