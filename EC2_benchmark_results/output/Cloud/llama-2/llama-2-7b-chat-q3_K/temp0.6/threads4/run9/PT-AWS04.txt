Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(D) 6

Explanation:
When scaling up the number of shards in your Kinesis data stream, it's important to ensure that you don't overload your EC2 instances with too much work. The optimal number of EC2 instances will depend on factors such as the size and complexity of your data streams, the volume of data being processed, and the amount of CPU and memory available on each instance.
In this case, since you have resharded your stream to six open shards, the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance is six. Launching more than six instances would result in too much work being allocated to each instance, leading to slower processing times and potential errors.
Option (A) 5 is incorrect because five EC2 instances are not enough to handle the increased load generated by resharding your stream to six open shards. Option (B) 12 is also incorrect because twelve EC2 instances would result in too much work being allocated to each instance, leading to slower processing times and potential errors. Option (C) 3 is incorrect because three EC2 instances are not enough to handle the increased load generated by resharding your stream to six open shards.
