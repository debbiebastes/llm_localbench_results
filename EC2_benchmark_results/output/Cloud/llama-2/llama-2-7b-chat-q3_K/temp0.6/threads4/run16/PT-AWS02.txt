The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (C): Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the IT Security team needs to immediately mitigate a security risk by patching the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The best solution is to use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. This solution provides an easy and efficient way to manage and track patches across multiple EC2 instances without manual intervention.
Moreover, it's essential to record and track any configuration changes. AWS Config provides a centralized management tool that can be used to track and monitor all of the configurations for the EC2 instances, including the patch status. By integrating AWS Config with Patch Manager, the team can ensure that all changes are properly recorded and tracked.
Option (A) is not the best solution as it involves using Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track configuration changes, which may not be the most efficient or practical solution in this scenario. Option (B) is also not the best solution as it involves setting up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager without any additional integration, which may not provide the same level of monitoring and tracking capabilities as option (C). Finally, option (D) is not a feasible solution as it requires manual intervention to install patches on a weekly basis, which may not be practical or efficient in this scenario.
