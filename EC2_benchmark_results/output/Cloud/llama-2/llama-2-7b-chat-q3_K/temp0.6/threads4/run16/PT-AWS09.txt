A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

API Gateway provides an option for throttling, which can be used to limit the number of requests that can be made to an API within a certain time frame. This can help prevent the backend systems from being overwhelmed with traffic and mitigate the impact of sudden traffic spikes. Additionally, result caching in API Gateway allows for storing the results of previous requests, which can reduce the load on the backend systems by reducing the number of requests that need to be made.
Option (A) is incorrect because while EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling can provide a more scalable architecture, they are not directly related to protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes. Option (C) is also incorrect because CloudFront is primarily used for caching at the edge of the network, and it does not provide the same level of protection as throttling limits in API Gateway. Option (D) is incorrect because moving a Lambda function to a VPC does not directly affect its ability to handle traffic spikes.
