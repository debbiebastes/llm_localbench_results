A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The most likely root cause of this issue is (B): The endpoint request timed-out. When a Lambda function is invoked through an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration, the function has a timeout value set by default. This means that if the underlying function takes longer than this time to complete, the API Gateway will return a 502 Bad Gateway error.
In this case, it's possible that the Lambda function is taking longer than the default timeout value to complete, causing the 502 error when the API is called. To troubleshoot this issue, the developer can check the Lambda function's timeout value and adjust it as needed to avoid exceeding the timeout during execution.
