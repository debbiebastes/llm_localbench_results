An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.
Here's why:

You need a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, and you want to use an object storage service (S3) to store the backup data. After 30 days, you want to transition the data to a data archiving storage service (such as S3 Glacier or S3 One Zone-IA).
Attaching an EBS volume in your EC2 instance will provide the persistent block storage you need for your mission-critical workloads. You can store your backup data on the EBS volume, and then configure a lifecycle policy to transition the data to S3 after 30 days. This will allow you to take advantage of the scalability and durability of S3 while still maintaining a persistent block storage volume for your mission-critical workloads.
Option (A) is not the best choice because instance store volumes are ephemeral, meaning they are deleted when the EC2 instance is terminated. This means that you would lose your data if you relied solely on an instance store volume for your backup data.
Option (C) is also not the best choice because S3 One Zone-IA is a storage class that is optimized for read-heavy workloads, whereas you need a storage class that can handle both read and write operations for your mission-critical workloads.
Finally, option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not available in all regions, so they may not be suitable for your needs.
