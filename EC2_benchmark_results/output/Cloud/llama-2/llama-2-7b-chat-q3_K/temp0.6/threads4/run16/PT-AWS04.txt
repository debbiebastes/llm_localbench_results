Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6.

Explanation: As your application is using Kinesis data streams with four shards, increasing the number of open shards to six will increase the parallelism and throughput of your processing pipeline. However, launching more than six EC2 instances will not lead to any performance improvement as the additional instances will be idle most of the time due to limited parallelism in the stream processing pipeline. Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched for optimal performance is six.
