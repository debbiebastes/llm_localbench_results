An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance.

Explanation:

As you need a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, using an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume is the best option. An EBS volume provides high-performance, durable storage that is designed for use cases that require data persistence.
Since you will be storing your backup data in Amazon S3, which is a object storage service, you cannot use instance store or instance volume to store your data.
Option (A) is not the correct choice because instance store volumes are intended for temporary use and do not provide the same level of durability as EBS volumes.
Option (C) is also not the correct choice because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a storage service that provides high availability and low latency for data stored across multiple Availability Zones in a single region, but it does not provide the same level of persistence as an EBS volume.
Option (D) is not the correct choice because while instance store volumes are intended for temporary use, they do not provide the same level of durability as EBS volumes.
