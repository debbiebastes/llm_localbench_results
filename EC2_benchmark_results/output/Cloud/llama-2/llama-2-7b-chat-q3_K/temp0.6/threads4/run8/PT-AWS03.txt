A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
AWS Config is a service that allows you to manage and monitor AWS resources according to specific configurations or rules. By using AWS Config, you can automatically detect security groups that allow inbound traffic from any source IP address, including the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Once detected, you can use an associated Systems Manager Automation document to update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address, thereby remediating the security risk.
Option (B) is not the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because it involves setting up a Transit VPC, which can be complex and time-consuming. Option (C) is also not the best solution because Network ACLs are not designed to automatically monitor and detect security groups that allow traffic directly from any source IP address. Option (D) is not a feasible solution because AWS Shield does not have the capability to automatically monitor and detect security groups that allow traffic directly from any source IP address.
