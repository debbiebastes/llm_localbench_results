The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the company’s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (C): Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager can automatically detect and apply security patches and software updates on EC2 instances with old operating systems, ensuring that they are up-to-date and secure. By using Patch Manager, the IT Security team can easily manage and automate the patching process for these instances without having to manually install the patches or configure Amazon ES or Amazon QuickSight.
AWS Config provides a comprehensive audit log of all changes made to the AWS environment, including any configuration changes related to patch management. By using Config, the IT Security team can track and record any changes made to the EC2 instances’ patch status over time, providing a complete audit trail for compliance and security purposes.
Option (A) is not the most suitable solution because it involves using Systems Manager Sessions Manager, which may not provide the same level of automation or granularity as Patch Manager when managing patches for EC2 instances with old operating systems.
Option (B) is not the most suitable solution because it involves setting up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy patches on a regular basis, which may not be necessary for all instances and could lead to unnecessary costs or resource usage.
Option (D) is not the most suitable solution because it does not provide an automated way to manage patches for EC2 instances with old operating systems.
