A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements would be option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
Here's why:

1. EventBridge (formerly known as CloudWatch Events): EventBridge is a fully managed service that allows you to react to changes in AWS services, including DynamoDB table events. It provides a centralized way to manage and monitor event sources, process events, and act on them.
2. Lambda function: You can set up a Lambda function as the rule target for the EventBridge rule. The Lambda function will be triggered every time an event occurs in DynamoDB, and it will process and save new changes to the other table. This way, you don't have to manually copy data from one table to another, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.
3. Decoupling: By using EventBridge and Lambda, you decouple the application logic (the Lambda function) from the event source (DynamoDB). This allows you to modify or replace the Lambda function without affecting the application's underlying data storage.
4. Region-based data replication: By storing the new changes in a DynamoDB table in another region, you ensure that your data is replicated across two regions. This provides high availability and durability for your data, as well as fast access to the data from any region.
In summary, option (C) is the most ideal way to comply with the requirements because it uses EventBridge and Lambda to process and save new changes to the other table in a centralized, efficient, and scalable manner.
