A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The most operationally efficient solution to implement would be (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
A scheduled scaling policy allows you to specify when and how many instances should be created or removed based on a schedule. This can help ensure that there are enough instances available during peak usage hours, such as the beginning of the workday, to handle increased traffic and demand.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group would not address the issue of slow performance at the beginning of the day as it relies on predicting future usage patterns based on historical data. Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on Memory utilization may cause unnecessary instance launches if the memory usage is not consistently high throughout the day, and option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on CPU utilization would not address the issue of slow performance at the beginning of the day.
