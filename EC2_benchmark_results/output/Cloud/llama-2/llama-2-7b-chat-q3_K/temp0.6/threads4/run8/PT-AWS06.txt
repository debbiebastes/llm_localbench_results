A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The most likely root cause of this issue is (B) The endpoint request timed-out.

When a Lambda function is invoked through an API Gateway proxy integration, the request may time out if it takes longer than the configured timeout period to complete. This can result in a 502 Bad Gateway error being returned to the client. In this scenario, the developer should check the timeout settings for the Lambda function and adjust them as necessary to prevent timeouts from occurring.
