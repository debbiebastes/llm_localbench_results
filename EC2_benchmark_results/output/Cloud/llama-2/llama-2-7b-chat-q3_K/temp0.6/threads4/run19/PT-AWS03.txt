A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. This approach involves creating an AWS Config rule that monitors for the presence of the inbound traffic rule on any security group and then associates a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Option (A) is the most efficient because it leverages AWS Config, which is designed specifically for configuring and managing resources in AWS. By using AWS Config rules, the Security Engineer can easily detect whether there are any security groups that allow inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range without having to manually check each security group. Once the rule is triggered, the Systems Manager Automation document will be executed automatically, ensuring that the security group is updated with the correct IP address.
Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances, which may not be necessary in this scenario since it does not address the security risk directly. Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, which is a manual process that may not be efficient or scalable for large environments. Option (D) uses AWS Shield to monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but it does not provide a way to automatically remediate the security risk.
