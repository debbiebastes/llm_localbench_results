A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation: The Security Engineer should implement Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key to ensure that the sensitive PII is encrypted at rest and in transit, even if the bucket is accessed by an unauthorized party. Client-side encryption means that only authorized clients can decrypt the data, providing an additional layer of security and compliance with regulatory requirements.

Option (A) is incorrect because client-side master keys are not secure enough for storing sensitive PII. Option (C) is also incorrect because server-side encryption does not provide client-side encryption, which is a necessary requirement for this scenario. Option (D) is incorrect because customers cannot manage KMS keys on their own; they must use KMS-managed customer master keys.
