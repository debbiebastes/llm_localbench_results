A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The most cost-effective option would be (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
Reserved Instances provide significant savings compared to On-Demand instances, and the longer the term you commit to, the greater the savings. By committing to a 3-year term, the company can save even more money compared to a 1-year term with All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing.
Option (A) does not provide the best value as it is for a 1-year term and does not take advantage of the long-term savings that come with Reserved Instances. Option (B) does not make sense as it is for a shorter term than what the company is currently using, so they would not be able to achieve the cost savings from Reserved Instances.
