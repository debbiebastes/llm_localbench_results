Which AWS service enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture?

(A) Amazon SQS
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events)
(C) Amazon SNS
(D) Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events).

Explanation:
EventBridge, also known as Amazon CloudWatch Events, is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. With EventBridge, you can set up events and triggers based on changes in your system or external sources, such as logs, metrics, or IoT devices. These events can then be passed to other AWS services or applications through APIs, messaging systems, or other integration methods.
Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a message queue service that allows you to decouple components of your application architecture by sending messages between them. However, it does not provide the same level of event-driven functionality as EventBridge.
Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a messaging service that allows you to send messages from one service or application to another. It can be used for event-driven architecture, but it is not as flexible as EventBridge in terms of the types of events and triggers it supports.
Amazon Kinesis is a streaming service that can be used for real-time data processing and event-driven architecture. However, it is focused more on real-time data processing rather than event-driven architecture per se.
