An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:
An EBS volume provides a persistent block storage volume that can be attached to multiple EC2 instances, while an instance store is specific to a single EC2 instance. Therefore, option (A) is not suitable as it only provides a temporary attachment for the volume.
Option (C) is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA does not provide a persistent storage solution for mission-critical workloads. Amazon S3 Glacier, on the other hand, provides a long-term archival storage solution that is optimized for infrequently accessed data.
Option (D) is also incorrect as instance store volumes are specific to a single EC2 instance and cannot be used for mission-critical workloads that require persistent storage.
