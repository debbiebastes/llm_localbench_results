A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation:
The performance issue during the start of the day can be attributed to the instance types and sizes not being optimized for the increased workload during this period. By configuring a Scheduled scaling policy, you can launch new instances before the start of the day, which will help distribute the workload across all instances and improve performance.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy is not the most operationally efficient solution as it relies on historical data to predict future usage patterns, which may not always be accurate. Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on Memory utilization will also not solve the performance issue during the start of the day as memory utilization alone may not provide an accurate measure of workload. Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on CPU utilization is also not the best solution as it can lead to overprovisioning of resources during periods of low usage, resulting in unnecessary costs.
