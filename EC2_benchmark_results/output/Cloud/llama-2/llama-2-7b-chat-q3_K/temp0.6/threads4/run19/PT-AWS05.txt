A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements would be option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
EventBridge is a fully managed service that allows you to route AWS CloudWatch events to Lambda functions or other services. By setting up an EventBridge rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, you can automatically capture any new changes made to items in the original DynamoDB table and save them to the other table in another region.
Option (A) is not ideal because DynamoDB Accelerator is a separate product from DynamoDB that provides low-latency reads for applications with high read throughput requirements. It does not provide the functionality of tracking changes made to items in DynamoDB.
Option (B) is not ideal because Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) is a feature of Amazon RDS that allows you to restore an Amazon RDS database instance to a point in time up to 7 days ago. It does not provide the functionality of tracking changes made to items in DynamoDB.
Option (D) is also not ideal because DynamoDB Streams is a feature of DynamoDB that enables you to stream data changes from a table to other services, such as Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose or Amazon S3. It does not provide the functionality of tracking changes made to items in DynamoDB.
