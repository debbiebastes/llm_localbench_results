A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
API Gateway provides a built-in feature called "throttling" that allows you to control the amount of traffic that can be sent to your backend API. By enabling throttling, you can limit the number of requests that are allowed to pass through to your backend system during times of high traffic.
Additionally, API Gateway also provides a feature called "result caching," which allows you to cache the results of previous API calls. This means that if the same request is made multiple times within a short period of time, the API can return the cached result instead of making the same request to the backend system each time. This can help reduce the load on your backend systems during periods of high traffic.
Option (A) is incorrect because while EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling can provide a more scalable architecture, they are not necessary for protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes. Option (C) is also incorrect because CloudFront can only act as a cache for static content, and it cannot be used to handle the load of API requests. Option (D) is also incorrect because moving the Lambda function to a VPC would not provide any protection against traffic spikes.
