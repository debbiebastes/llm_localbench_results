The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the company’s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:
The best solution in this scenario is option (C). AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides an easy way to deploy OS patches across multiple EC2 instances at once, reducing the effort required to mitigate the security risk. Additionally, setting up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes ensures that all changes are properly documented for audit purposes. Option (A) is not suitable because it involves using Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, which may not be necessary in this scenario. Option (B) requires setting up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Option (D) does not provide a centralized solution for managing patches across multiple EC2 instances.
