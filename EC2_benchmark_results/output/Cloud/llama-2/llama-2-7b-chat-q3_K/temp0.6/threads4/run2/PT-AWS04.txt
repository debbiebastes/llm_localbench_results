Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The answer is (D) 6.

As you have resharded your stream to increase the number of open shards from four to six, you will need at least six EC2 instances to process the data stream optimally. Having more than six instances may not provide any additional performance benefits, and launching fewer instances may result in bottlenecks in processing the data stream.
Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance is six.
