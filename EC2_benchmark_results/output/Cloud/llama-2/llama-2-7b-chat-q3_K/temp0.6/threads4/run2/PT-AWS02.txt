The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (B): Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.

Reasoning:

AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides a centralized and automated way to manage patches across multiple EC2 instances, including those with old operating systems. By using Patch Manager, the IT Security team can quickly identify and deploy security patches to all affected instances, mitigating the security risk immediately.
Additionally, Amazon ES (Elastic Search Service) provides a scalable and flexible data storage solution that can be used to record and track any configuration changes made as part of the patch management process. This ensures compliance requirements are met and any changes are properly documented for auditing purposes.
Option (A) does not provide a centralized and automated way to manage patches across multiple EC2 instances, and therefore is not a suitable solution. Option (C) is similar to (B) but uses AWS Config instead of Patch Manager, which may have some limitations in managing patches for large number of instances. Option (D) does not provide any automated way to manage patches and is not a feasible solution for mitigating the security risk.
