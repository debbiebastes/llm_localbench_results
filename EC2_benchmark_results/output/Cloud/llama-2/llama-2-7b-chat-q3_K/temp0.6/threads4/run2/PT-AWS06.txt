A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 

The most likely root cause of this issue is (B): The endpoint request timed-out.

When a Lambda function is invoked through an AWS API Gateway proxy integration, the underlying function has a time limit to complete its execution. If the function does not return within that time limit (502 Bad Gateway), the API Gateway returns a 502 error to the client. This is why the developer received a 502 error instead of the expected result from the Lambda function.
Option (A) is incorrect because there is no indication in the question that the output returned by the Lambda function is incompatible with Amazon API Gateway proxy integration. Option (C) is also unlikely, as there is no mention of heavy loads causing out-of-order invocations. Finally, option (D) is incorrect because the API name specified in the question is valid and does not cause this error.
