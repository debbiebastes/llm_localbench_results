A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:
AWS provides several encryption options for storing data in S3, but to ensure compliance with the company's strict security policies, the Security Engineer should consider using client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This approach allows the company to manage their own master keys securely and maintain control over the encryption process while still leveraging AWS's S3 storage capabilities.
Option (A) is not feasible as it requires storing the master key on the client side, which poses a significant security risk. Option (C) is also not feasible as it involves using a server-side encryption method that may not provide the necessary level of control and security for the sensitive data. Finally, option (D) is not feasible as it requires providing AWS with access to the customer's master key, which goes against the company's security policies and compliance requirements.
