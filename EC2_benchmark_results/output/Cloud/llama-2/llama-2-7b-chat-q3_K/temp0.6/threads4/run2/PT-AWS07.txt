A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (A): Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances. This solution is operationally efficient because it allows the CRM application to automatically scale up to meet the increased demand at the beginning of the day, without manual intervention or scheduling.
Predictive scaling uses machine learning algorithms to predict future usage patterns based on historical data and other factors, such as time of day and day of week. By configuring a Predictive scaling policy, the CRM application can automatically scale up to meet the increased demand at the beginning of the day, without any manual intervention or scheduling required. This helps ensure that the application is always available and performing well for users during office hours.
Option (B) Configuring a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on Memory utilization is not operationally efficient as it would require manual intervention to set up and monitor, and may not account for changes in usage patterns over time. Option (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day is not operationally efficient as it does not take into account any variations in usage patterns during the rest of the day. Option (D) Configuring a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on CPU utilization is not operationally efficient as it may not accurately reflect changes in usage patterns over time or handle unexpected spikes in usage.
