An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. 
Here's why:
An EBS volume provides persistent block storage, which meets the requirement for mission-critical workloads. Unlike instance store volumes, EBS volumes are not tied to a specific EC2 instance and can be attached to multiple instances, making them more flexible.
Using Amazon S3 to store backup data is also a good choice because it provides a scalable and durable storage solution that can handle large amounts of data. By configuring a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier or One Zone-IA, you can optimize the cost and performance of your storage based on your organization's needs.
Option (A) is not the best choice because instance store volumes are tied to a specific EC2 instance and cannot be attached to multiple instances. Option (C) is also not the best choice because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA does not provide the same level of durability as Amazon S3 Glacier or EBS, and may not meet your organization's performance requirements.
