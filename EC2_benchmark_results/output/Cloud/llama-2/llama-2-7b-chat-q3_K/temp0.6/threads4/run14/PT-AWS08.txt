An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The answer is (B) - Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Reasoning:
You need a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads, so you should use an EBS volume instead of an instance store volume. Additionally, you want to store the backup data in Amazon S3, which provides a highly durable and scalable object store. You can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which will provide long-term archiving capabilities at lower cost. Using Amazon S3 Glacier will also help you to reduce the cost of storing large amounts of data over time.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not persistent and do not provide durable storage for mission-critical workloads. Option (C) is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a different service than Amazon S3 Glacier, and it does not provide the same level of archiving capabilities. Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not EBS volumes, and they do not provide the same level of performance or durability as EBS volumes.
