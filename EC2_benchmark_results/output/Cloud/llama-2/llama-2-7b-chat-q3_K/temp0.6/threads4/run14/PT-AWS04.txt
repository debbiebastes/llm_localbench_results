Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation: When resharding the Kinesis data stream, increasing the number of open shards from four to six, it will increase the parallel processing capacity. In order to achieve optimum performance, you should launch a maximum of six EC2 instances with one KCL worker each, assuming that there are no other constraints such as network bandwidth or storage capacity limitations.
