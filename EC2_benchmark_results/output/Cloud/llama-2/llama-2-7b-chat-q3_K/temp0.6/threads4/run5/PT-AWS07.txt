A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.

Explanation:
The application is experiencing slow performance at the beginning of the day, which suggests that there may be insufficient instances available to handle the workload during this time period. A scheduled scaling policy can be configured to launch new instances before the start of the day, ensuring that there are enough instances available to handle the workload and provide better performance for users during peak hours.
Option (A) is incorrect because predictive scaling policies do not take into account the specific needs of the application at different times of the day. Option (B) is also incorrect because dynamic scaling policies only adjust instance sizes based on memory utilization, which may not address the issue of slow performance at the beginning of the day. Option (D) is also incorrect because CPU utilization alone may not be a sufficient factor to determine when to launch new instances.
