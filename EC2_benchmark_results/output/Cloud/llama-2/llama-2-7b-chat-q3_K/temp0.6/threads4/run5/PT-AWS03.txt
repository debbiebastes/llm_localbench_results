A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Here's why:
AWS Config can automatically detect whether there are any security groups that allow traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which is the source of the security risk. By associating an AWS Lambda function with the AWS Config rule, you can automate the remediation process by updating the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is efficient because it reduces the need for manual intervention and minimizes the time required to remediate the security risk.
Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances, but this may not be necessary in this scenario since the security group changes are already being monitored by AWS Config. Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, but this approach may not be scalable or flexible enough to handle all instances of the security risk. Option (D) uses AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but this service is primarily designed for DNS security monitoring rather than network security monitoring.
