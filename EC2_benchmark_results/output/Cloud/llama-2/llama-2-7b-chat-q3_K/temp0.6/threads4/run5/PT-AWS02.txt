The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A): Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
Reasoning:
AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager provides a secure, automated, and scalable way to deploy patches across multiple EC2 instances at once. It also integrates with Kibana for easy tracking and monitoring of configuration changes. This solution is the most efficient and effective in mitigating the security risk as it can quickly deploy the patches to all affected instances simultaneously, reducing the risk of exposure.
Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, but this option does not provide the same level of automation and scalability as Option (A). Additionally, using Amazon ES for recording and tracking configuration changes may not be the most efficient or effective solution in this scenario.
Option (C) uses AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy patches, but it does not integrate with Kibana for monitoring and tracking configuration changes like Option (A).
Option (D) configures Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install OS patches on a weekly basis, but this approach may not be as effective in mitigating the security risk as it does not provide real-time deployment of patches.
