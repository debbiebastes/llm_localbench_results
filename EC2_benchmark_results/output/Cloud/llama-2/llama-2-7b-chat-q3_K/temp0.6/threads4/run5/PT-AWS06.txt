A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The most likely root cause of this issue is (B): The endpoint request timed-out.
When a Lambda function returns a result, it needs to be processed and returned to the client within a certain time frame. If this time frame is exceeded, the API Gateway will return a 502 Bad Gateway error. It's possible that the underlying Lambda function took longer than expected to execute, causing the request to timeout.
Option (A) is incorrect because there is no information provided in the given scenario about an incompatible output being returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend. Option (C) is also unlikely, as there is no indication of any heavy loads causing occasional out-of-order invocations. Option (D) is incorrect because the API name is not mentioned in the given scenario.
