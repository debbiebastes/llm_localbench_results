A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The answer is (B): No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
Explanation:
Reserved Instances offer a cost savings compared to On-Demand instances, but the exact amount of savings depends on the length of time you commit to using the instance. If you plan to use the application for more than 3 years, then committing to a 3-year term with No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing is the most cost-effective option.
Option (A) provides the lowest upfront cost but does not provide any long-term savings, while options (C) and (D) do not provide the same level of cost savings as option (B).
