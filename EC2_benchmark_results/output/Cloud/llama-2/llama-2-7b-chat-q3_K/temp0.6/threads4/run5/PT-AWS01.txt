A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:
Amazon S3 provides two types of encryption for data stored in buckets: server-side encryption and client-side encryption. Server-side encryption encrypts the data at rest and in transit, whereas client-side encryption encrypts the data at rest. In this scenario, since the sensitive PII must never be sent to AWS, client-side encryption is more appropriate.
With client-side encryption, the master key is managed by the customer, and not by AWS. This ensures that the company maintains control over its encryption keys, which are required to comply with strict regulatory requirements. By using a KMS-managed customer master key, the Security Engineer can securely manage and rotate their encryption keys without relying on AWS.
Option (A) is not the correct choice because client-side encryption requires the client (in this case, the web application hosted in AWS) to handle the encryption process. This could lead to security risks if the application is not properly secured. Option (C) is also not the correct choice because server-side encryption encrypts data at rest using a KMS key managed by AWS, which conflicts with the requirement of maintaining control over the encryption keys.
