An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Reason:
An EBS volume is the best choice for a persistent block storage volume because it provides block-level access, which is necessary for storing mission-critical workloads. Using Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier is the right solution to meet the requirement of storing backed data in an object storage service after 30 days. Amazon S3 Glacier provides long-term archival storage with low costs and infrequent access.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are designed for use as temporary storage during EC2 instance creation or termination, and they don't provide persistent storage. Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a suitable choice for storing mission-critical workloads. It provides low latency and high availability but doesn't provide the necessary block-level access that an EBS volume offers.
