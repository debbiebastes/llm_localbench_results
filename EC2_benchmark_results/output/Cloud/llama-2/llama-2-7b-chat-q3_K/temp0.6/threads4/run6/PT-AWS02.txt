The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (B): Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
Here's why:
AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides a convenient and automated way to manage patches across AWS resources, including EC2 instances. It can be used to quickly deploy patches to multiple instances at once, reducing the risk of security breaches caused by outdated software. Additionally, Amazon ES (Elastic Search Service) can be used to record and track any configuration changes made using Systems Manager Patch Manager, providing a auditable history of all patch management activities.
Option (A) is not the best choice because it involves deploying patches using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager, which is not a recommended solution for managing patches across multiple instances at once. Option (C) is also not the best choice because it involves using AWS Config, which is primarily used for configuring and managing AWS resources, rather than patch management. Option (D) is also not the best choice because it involves relying on automated patch installation schedules, which may not provide real-time visibility into patch status or allow for manual intervention in case of emergencies.
