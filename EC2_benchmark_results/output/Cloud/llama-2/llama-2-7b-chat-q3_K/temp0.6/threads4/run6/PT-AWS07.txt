A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The most operationally efficient solution to ensure that the application works properly at the beginning of the day is option (C): Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
By scheduling the scaling policy to launch new instances just before office hours begin, you can ensure that there are enough instances available to handle the increased demand at the start of the day. This will help mitigate the slow performance issues experienced by users during the early morning hours.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy is not the most operationally efficient solution as it relies on predicting future usage patterns, which can be challenging to accurately forecast. Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on Memory utilization may also not be effective in addressing the issue as memory utilization may not necessarily indicate the start of the day peak usage.
Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy to launch new instances based on CPU utilization is not relevant to the problem statement as it does not take into account the time of day.
