An e-commerce company wants to migrate its on-premise infrastructure to Amazon Web Services. However, they are worried about ensuring their migration is secure and efficient.

Which of the following AWS Cloud Adoption Framework perspective would be the most essential for the companyâ€™s migration?

(A) Security Perspective
(B) Governance Perspective

Answer: 
(D) Platform Perspective.

Explanation: The Platform Perspective is concerned with the design and implementation of the AWS services and infrastructure that will be used to support the company's e-commerce platform. This includes selecting the appropriate AWS services for storage, compute, database, and security, as well as configuring and optimizing those services for efficient use.
In this scenario, the Platform Perspective would be crucial in ensuring that the company's migration is secure and efficient. By focusing on the platform perspective, the company can design and implement a secure and efficient e-commerce infrastructure on AWS, which will help ensure a successful migration.
