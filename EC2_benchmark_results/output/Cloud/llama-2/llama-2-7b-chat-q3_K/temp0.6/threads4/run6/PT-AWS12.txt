A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The most cost-effective option would be (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
Standard Reserved Instances offer a discount of up to 75% compared to On-Demand pricing, and the longer term commitment can result in even greater cost savings. By committing to a 3-year term, the company can lock in these lower prices for a significant portion of their hosting needs, which can save them money in the long run.
Option (A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term would be more expensive than Standard Reserved Instances and would not offer the same level of cost savings over a longer period of time. Option (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term would also not offer any cost savings, as there is no commitment to the instance beyond the initial 1-year term. Option (D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year would be more expensive than Standard Reserved Instances and would require continuous renewal of the instance to maintain the lower prices.
