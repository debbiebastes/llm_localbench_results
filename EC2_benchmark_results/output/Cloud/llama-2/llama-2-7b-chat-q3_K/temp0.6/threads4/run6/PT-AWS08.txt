An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (A): Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
Instance stores are designed for use as a persistent block storage volume for EC2 instances. They provide fast and reliable access to the data stored on them, making them ideal for mission-critical workloads. Amazon S3 provides a scalable and durable object store that can be used to store backup data for long-term archival purposes. By attaching an instance store volume to your EC2 instance, you can use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. This will allow you to store your data in a cost-effective and durable manner while still meeting the performance requirements for your mission-critical workloads.
