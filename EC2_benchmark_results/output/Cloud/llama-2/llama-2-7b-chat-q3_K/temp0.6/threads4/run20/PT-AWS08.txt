An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
An EBS volume provides persistent block storage, which is ideal for mission-critical workloads. You can attach an EBS volume to your EC2 instance and use it to store your backup data. Since you want to retain the data for 30 days before archiving it, you should configure a lifecycle policy in Amazon S3 that moves your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are ephemeral and do not provide persistent storage. Option (C) is also incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a data storage service that provides high availability and low latency for applications, but it does not provide the same level of durability as EBS or S3 Glacier.
Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are ephemeral and do not provide persistent storage.
