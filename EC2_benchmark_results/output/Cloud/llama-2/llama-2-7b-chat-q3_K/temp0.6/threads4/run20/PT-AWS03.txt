A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.
Here's why:
Option (A) uses AWS Config to automatically detect whether there are any security groups that allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. This is efficient because it automates the process of identifying and remediating the security risk without requiring manual intervention.
Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances, which may not be necessary in this scenario since the company already has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance.
Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, which is not a scalable solution as it would require manual intervention to update the Network ACL every time a new security group is created with the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.
Option (D) uses AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which may not be feasible in this scenario since the security risk is caused by developers adding rules to security groups without approval.
Therefore, option (A) is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk.
