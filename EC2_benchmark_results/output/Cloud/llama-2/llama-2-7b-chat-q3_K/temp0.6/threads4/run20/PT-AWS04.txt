Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6

Explanation: When resharding a Kinesis data stream, the number of open shards is increased, and each instance can handle a maximum of six shards. To achieve optimum performance in your application, you should launch at most six EC2 instances to work with the new number of open shards. Launching more than six instances would result in resource waste and reduced efficiency.
Option (D) 6 is the correct answer.
