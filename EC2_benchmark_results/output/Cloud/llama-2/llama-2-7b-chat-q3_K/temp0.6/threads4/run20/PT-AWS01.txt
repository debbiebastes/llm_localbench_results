A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
B. Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Reasoning:
To comply with regulatory requirements, the sensitive PII must not be sent to AWS for storage or processing, including the master keys. Therefore, option (A) is not suitable as it involves sending the master keys to AWS for encryption. Option (C) is also not suitable as it requires the customer to provide a key that can potentially be compromised.
Option (B) is the most appropriate choice because it involves using a KMS-managed customer master key, which means that the customer does not need to provide any sensitive information to AWS, including the master keys. This approach provides strong encryption and ensures regulatory compliance while maintaining control over the security of the data.
