A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The most likely root cause of this issue is (B) The endpoint request timed-out.
When a Lambda function is invoked through an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration, the underlying function may take more time to execute than expected. If the request times out before the function can complete its execution, the 502 Bad Gateway error will be returned to the caller. In this case, option (B) is the correct answer.
Option (A) is incorrect because there is no incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
Option (C) is also incorrect because occasional out-of-order invocations due to heavy loads do not cause 502 Bad Gateway errors.
Option (D) is incorrect because the API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is not a factor in this issue.
