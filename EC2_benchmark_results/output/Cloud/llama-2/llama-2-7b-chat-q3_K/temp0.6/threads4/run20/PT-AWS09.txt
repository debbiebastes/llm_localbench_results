A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

API Gateway is a fully managed service that provides a highly scalable, secure, and extensible interface for APIs. By enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway, you can ensure that the backend systems of the trading platform are protected from traffic spikes. Throttling limits can be set to restrict the number of requests that can be made within a given time frame, while result caching can store frequently accessed data in memory for faster retrieval. This would help prevent overloading and slow response times during high traffic events, ensuring that the platform's backend systems remain stable and available.
Option (A) is incorrect as it suggests using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling, which are not necessary for protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes. Option (C) is also incorrect as CloudFront is a content delivery network that can be used to distribute data but is not designed for caching API responses. Option (D) is incorrect as moving a Lambda function to a VPC does not provide any benefits in terms of protecting the backend systems from traffic spikes.
