An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
Option (C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is the correct answer.
Explanation:
Amazon S3 provides a highly durable and scalable object storage service that can be used for both current data access and long-term archival of mission-critical workloads. By attaching an EBS volume to your EC2 instance, you get block storage performance, which is ideal for workloads that require fast I/O operations.
To meet the requirement of storing backup data in S3, you can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects from Amazon S3 Standard Storage to Amazon S3 Infrequent Access (S3-IA) after 30 days. S3-IA provides a cost-effective storage solution for data that is unlikely to be accessed frequently, such as backup data.
Option (A) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not designed for long-term archival of mission-critical workloads and cannot provide the durability and scalability required for this use case.
Option (B) is also incorrect because EBS volumes are designed for block storage performance, not object storage. You would need to use Amazon S3 or another object storage service to store your backup data.
Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are attached to the EC2 instance at boot time and do not provide block storage performance like EBS volumes.
