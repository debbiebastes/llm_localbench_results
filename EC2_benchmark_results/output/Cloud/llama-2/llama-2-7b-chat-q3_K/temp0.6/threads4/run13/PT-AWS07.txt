A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution is (C): Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
By configuring a scheduled scaling policy, you can specify a specific time each day when the instances are launched, which will ensure that the application has enough resources available at the beginning of the day to handle the increased traffic and workload. This will help mitigate the slow performance issues experienced during the early hours of the day.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy is not the most operationally efficient solution as it relies on machine learning algorithms to predict future load changes, which may not always be accurate. Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on Memory utilization is also not the best solution as it can lead to overprovisioning of instances during non-peak hours, which can result in wasted resources and increased costs. Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on CPU utilization is also not the most operationally efficient solution as it may not take into account other factors that can affect application performance during peak hours.
