Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The answer is (D) 6.

When resharding a stream, the number of open shards increases by 50%, from four to six. This means that each instance will have an additional two KCL workers per shard, for a total of 2 x 6 = 12 KCL workers per instance. To achieve optimum performance, you should launch at most six EC2 instances, as this is the maximum number of KCL workers that can be supported by each instance.
