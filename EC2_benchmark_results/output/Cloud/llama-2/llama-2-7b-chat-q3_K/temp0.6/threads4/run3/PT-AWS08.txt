An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
You need a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, so you should use an EBS volume instead of an instance store volume. An EBS volume is a block storage device that persists data even if the underlying EC2 instance is terminated or fails.
Using Amazon S3 to store your backup data is a good choice because it provides low-cost archival storage and supports lifecycle policies for transitioning objects to Amazon S3 Glacier, which is a long-term archival storage service that can reduce costs by storing infrequently accessed data in a single location.
Option (A) is not correct because instance store volumes are not suitable for mission-critical workloads and do not provide the same level of durability as EBS volumes. Option (C) is also not correct because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not available in all regions, so it may not be a viable option for you.
Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not available in all regions, so they may not be a viable option for you.
