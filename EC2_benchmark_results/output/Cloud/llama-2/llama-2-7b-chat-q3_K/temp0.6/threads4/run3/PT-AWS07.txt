A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day is (C): Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
A scheduled scaling policy allows you to define a schedule for when new instances should be launched, including during off-peak hours. This can help ensure that there are enough instances available at the beginning of the day to handle the increased traffic and prevent slow performance.
Option (C) is the MOST operationally efficient solution because it provides more control over when instances are launched, rather than relying on a predictive or dynamic scaling policy which may not be able to accurately forecast usage patterns.
Options (A), (B), and (D) do not provide the same level of control as option (C) and are therefore less operationally efficient solutions for this use case.
