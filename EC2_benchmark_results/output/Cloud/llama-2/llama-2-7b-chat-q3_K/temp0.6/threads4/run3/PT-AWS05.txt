A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 

The MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements is option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
Here's why:
EventBridge is a fully managed service by AWS that allows you to react to changes in your AWS services, including DynamoDB. By creating an EventBridge rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB, you can automatically capture and process new changes made to the items in DynamoDB. This will allow you to save these changes to another DynamoDB table in another region, ensuring compliance with IT regulations.
Option (A) is not ideal as DynamoDB Accelerator is a separate service from DynamoDB that provides accelerated writes and reads for DynamoDB tables. It does not provide the necessary functionality to capture changes made to items in DynamoDB.
Option (B) is also not ideal as point-in-time recovery is a feature that allows you to recover data from a specific point in time, but it does not allow you to automatically capture and process new changes made to items in DynamoDB.
Option (D) is also not ideal as DynamoDB Streams is a feature that allows you to stream changes made to items in DynamoDB, but it does not provide the necessary functionality to automatically capture and process new changes made to items in DynamoDB.
