A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The most cost-effective option would be (C): All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
Reserved Instances provide significant savings compared to On-Demand instances, but the exact amount of savings depends on the length of time you reserve an instance for. For long-term commitments (i.e., more than 1 year), Reserved Instances can save up to 54% compared to On-Demand pricing.
By selecting option (C), you would pay a higher upfront cost for the Reserved Instance, but you would also enjoy lower hourly costs over the 3-year term of the commitment. Over time, this would result in significant savings compared to the other options.
Option (A) would provide the lowest upfront cost, but it would also have the highest hourly cost over the 1-year term of the commitment, making it less cost-effective in the long run. Option (B) would provide no upfront cost savings compared to On-Demand pricing, which could result in higher overall costs over the 3-year term of the commitment. Option (D) would provide some upfront cost savings, but the hourly costs would be higher than option (C), making it less cost-effective in the long run.
