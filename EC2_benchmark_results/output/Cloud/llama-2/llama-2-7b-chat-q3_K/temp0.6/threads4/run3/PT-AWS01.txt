A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:
Amazon S3 provides two types of encryption: client-side encryption and server-side encryption. Client-side encryption involves encrypting data on the client's side before uploading it to S3, while server-side encryption involves encrypting data on AWS servers before storing it in S3. For sensitive data like PII, it is recommended to use client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This ensures that the master key is securely managed by the organization and never leaves their control.
Option (A) is incorrect because client-side encryption with a client-side master key does not provide sufficient security for sensitive data like PII. Option (C) is also incorrect as server-side encryption is not suitable for storing sensitive data like PII, which requires strict compliance and regulatory requirements. Option (D) is incorrect because using a customer provided key is not secure and goes against AWS best practices for managing sensitive data.
