Answer: 
(B) Amazon EventBride (Amazon CloudWatch Events).

EventBridge is an AWS service that enables you to build event-driven applications and decouple the components of your application architecture. It allows you to connect different AWS services, such as AWS Lambda functions, Amazon S3 buckets, and Amazon Kinesis streams, to create a system of interconnected events that can trigger specific actions or processes in response to certain events.
