A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements would be option (C): Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
EventBridge is a serverless event monitoring and automation service provided by AWS that allows you to collect, process, and act upon events from various sources, including DynamoDB. By setting up an EventBridge rule that monitors table-level events in the main DynamoDB table, you can automatically capture new changes made to items in that table and save them to a separate DynamoDB table in another region.
Option (A) is not ideal because it requires additional infrastructure (DynamoDB Accelerator) to achieve the same outcome. Option (B) is also not ideal because it relies on Point-in-Time Recovery, which may have limitations and can lead to data loss in some scenarios. Option (D) is also not ideal because it involves enabling DynamoDB Streams, which may also have limitations and may require additional configuration and maintenance.
