The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is option (C): Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
Here's why:
AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides an easy way to manage patch management across multiple EC2 instances with old operating systems. By using Patch Manager, the IT Security team can quickly identify and deploy patches to all affected instances, ensuring that the company's applications are protected from security risks. Additionally, AWS Config can be used to record and track any configuration changes made to the patched instances, providing auditable evidence of compliance.
Option (A) is not the best solution because it involves using Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, which may not be necessary in this scenario. Option (B) is also not the best solution because AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides a more streamlined and efficient way to manage patches across multiple instances. Option (D) is not a viable solution because it does not provide an easy way to manage patches on a regular basis.
