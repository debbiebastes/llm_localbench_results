A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.
Explanation:
In this scenario, the hospital wants to store sensitive PII data in an Amazon S3 bucket while complying with strict compliance and regulatory requirements that forbid sending the master keys or unencrypted data to AWS. Client-side encryption is a good choice for this use case because it allows the hospital to manage their own encryption keys, which are never sent to AWS.
With client-side encryption, the hospital can create their own customer master key and manage it securely. They can then encrypt the sensitive PII data using the customer master key before storing it in S3. This ensures that even AWS cannot access the unencrypted data, as the encryption is managed by the hospital themselves.
Option (A) is not a viable choice because client-side encryption with a client-side master key requires the hospital to manage their own encryption keys securely, which may be challenging for sensitive PII data. Option (C) is also not a good choice because server-side encryption relies on AWS managing the encryption keys, which may not meet regulatory requirements. Option (D) is also not a viable choice as it requires the hospital to provide their own encryption key to AWS, which may be difficult to manage securely.
