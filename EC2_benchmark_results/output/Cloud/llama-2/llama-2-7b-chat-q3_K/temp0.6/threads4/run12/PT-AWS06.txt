A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B) The endpoint request timed-out.

When a Lambda function is invoked through an API Gateway proxy integration, the request will time out if the underlying Lambda function does not complete within a certain amount of time, typically 15 minutes. This can cause a 502 Bad Gateway error to be returned to the client. To troubleshoot this issue, the developer can check the Lambda function logs for any errors or latency issues that may be causing the function to take longer than expected to complete.
