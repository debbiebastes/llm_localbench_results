An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Explanation:
An EBS volume is a block storage device that provides persistent storage for EC2 instances. It is the best choice for storing mission-critical data because it offers high performance, high availability, and durability.
To store backup data in Amazon S3, you can create an S3 bucket and mount it to your EC2 instance using an NFS or iSCSI volume. You can then configure a lifecycle policy in Amazon S3 to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. This will allow you to store the data at a lower cost while still maintaining access to the data for up to 90 days.
Option (A) is not the best choice because instance store volumes are not designed for long-term storage and do not provide the same level of durability as EBS or S3. Option (C) is also not the best choice because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA does not offer the same level of durability as Amazon S3 Glacier, and it may not be available in all regions.
Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not persistent storage and do not provide the same level of durability as EBS or S3.
