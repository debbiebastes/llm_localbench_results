A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 
The MOST operationally efficient solution to implement is (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
A scheduled scaling policy allows you to specify a schedule for when instances should be launched or terminated, which can help ensure that there are enough instances available at the beginning of the day to handle the increased traffic. This can help prevent slow performance during the early morning hours.
Option (A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances is not the best solution as it relies on machine learning algorithms to predict future usage, which may not always be accurate.
Option (B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization can lead to over-provisioning of instances during low memory utilization periods, resulting in unnecessary costs.
Option (D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization is not relevant to the problem stated as it does not address the issue of slow performance at the beginning of the day.
