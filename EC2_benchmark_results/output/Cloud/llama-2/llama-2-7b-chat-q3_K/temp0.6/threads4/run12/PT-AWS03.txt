A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is option (A). Using AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range and associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address is the most efficient approach.
This approach leverages the power of AWS Config rules to automate the process of detecting and updating the security groups that allow traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, without requiring manual intervention or additional infrastructure. By using Systems Manager Automation, you can automatically update the security group rules with the corporate firewall IP address, ensuring that only authorized traffic is allowed through.
Option (B) setting up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances is not the most efficient approach as it requires additional infrastructure and configuration, which may increase costs and complexity.
Option (C) blocking the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL is not a viable solution as it only restricts traffic to specific IP ranges, but does not address the underlying security risk of allowing inbound traffic without proper approval.
Option (D) using AWS Shield to monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is also not a viable solution as it only provides monitoring capabilities, but does not offer automated remediation or update of security group rules.
