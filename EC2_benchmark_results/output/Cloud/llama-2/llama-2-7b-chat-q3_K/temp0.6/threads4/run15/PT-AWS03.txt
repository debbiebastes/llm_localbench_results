A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
Using AWS Config rules, you can automatically detect whether there are any security groups that allow inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Once the detection is made, you can use Systems Manager Automation to remediate the issue by updating the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is efficient because it automates the remediation process, reducing the need for manual intervention and minimizing the risk of errors or oversights.
Option (B) sets up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances, but this approach does not directly address the security risk posed by allowing inbound traffic from any IP address. Option (C) blocks the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, but this approach is not scalable and may not be able to detect all instances of the security risk. Option (D) uses AWS Shield to monitor and detect security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but this option does not provide a way to automatically remediate the issue.
