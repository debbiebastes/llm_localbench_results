A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.

The error message indicates that the request timed out, which means that the underlying function took too long to execute. Since this issue occurs when invoking the Lambda function through Amazon API Gateway proxy integration, it's likely that the delay is caused by the lambda function itself rather than the AWS infrastructure. Therefore, option (A) is the most likely root cause of this issue.
