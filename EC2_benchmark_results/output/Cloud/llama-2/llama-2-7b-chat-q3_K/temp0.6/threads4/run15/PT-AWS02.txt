The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is option (C): Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances, and set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
Here's why:

Option (A) Deploying the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager is not a suitable solution because it does not provide a convenient way to manage and track the patches. Additionally, integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana may not be necessary for this scenario.
Option (B) Setting up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems is also not a suitable solution because it does not allow for easy management and tracking of the patches.
Option (D) Configuring the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis is also not a suitable solution because it may not provide real-time monitoring and tracking of the patch status, and may require manual intervention to address any issues that arise.
By using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, the IT Security team can easily manage and track the patches for the outdated EC2 instances in real-time. Additionally, setting up AWS Config provides a record of all configuration changes made to the instances, which is necessary for audit purposes.
