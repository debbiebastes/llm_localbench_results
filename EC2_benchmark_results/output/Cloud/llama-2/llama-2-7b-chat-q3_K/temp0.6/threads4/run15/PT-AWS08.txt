An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
To meet the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, you should choose option (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. An EBS volume provides block-level storage that is persistently stored and can be attached to multiple instances, making it ideal for storing data that needs to be preserved for a long time.
Option (A) does not provide persistence as instance store volumes are ephemeral and do not provide durable storage. Option (C) also does not provide persistence as Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a distributed storage service that does not provide the same level of data durability as EBS.
Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are not available in all regions, so it may not be feasible to use them for all instances.
