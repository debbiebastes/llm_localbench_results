Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(D) 6.

Explanation: When resharding your Kinesis stream from four shards to six, each instance will be assigned two additional shards. To achieve optimum performance, you should launch a maximum of six EC2 instances to handle the increased number of shards and data processing requirements. Launching more than six instances may lead to unnecessary overhead costs without providing any performance benefits.
