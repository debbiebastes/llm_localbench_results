A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
Explanation:
In this scenario, the hospital's web application should use client-side encryption to protect the sensitive PII data stored in Amazon S3 buckets. Using a KMS-managed customer master key ensures that the hospital retains control over its encryption keys and maintains compliance with regulatory requirements. The Security Engineer can use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage the customer master key, which provides an additional layer of security and control over the encryption process.
Option (A) is incorrect because client-side encryption does not provide the same level of security as KMS-managed client-side encryption. With client-side encryption, the hospital would need to manage its own encryption keys, which could lead to compliance issues.
Option (C) is also incorrect because server-side encryption is not suitable for storing sensitive PII data. Server-side encryption is typically used to protect data in transit, not at rest.
Option (D) is incorrect because using a customer provided key would require the hospital to manage its own encryption keys, which could lead to compliance issues and potential security risks.
