A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B): Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.

By enabling throttling limits, you can set a limit on the number of requests that can be made to your API within a certain time frame. This can help prevent overwhelming your backend systems with an influx of new users trying to access the platform during a price surge.
Result caching in API Gateway allows you to cache the results of API calls, so when a user makes a request for the same information repeatedly, the cached response is returned instead of re-executing the Lambda function every time, which helps reduce the load on your backend systems.
