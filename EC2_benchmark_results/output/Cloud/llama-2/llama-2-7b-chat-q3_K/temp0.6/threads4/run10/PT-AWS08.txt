An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
To meet the requirement of having a persistent block storage volume for mission-critical workloads, option (D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance is the best choice.
Instance stores are fast and provide high throughput, making them ideal for use with EC2 instances that require frequent disk access. Unlike EBS volumes, which can be slow for read/write operations, instance stores can provide faster data transfer rates for workloads that require frequent disk access.
Option (A) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance is not the best choice because EBS volumes are block-level storage volumes that can take longer to initialize and may have slower performance compared to instance stores. While Amazon S3 can be used to store backup data, it may not provide the same level of performance as an instance store for mission-critical workloads.
Option (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance is also not the best choice because EBS volumes are block-level storage volumes that can take longer to initialize and may have slower performance compared to instance stores. While Amazon S3 can be used to store backup data, it may not provide the same level of performance as an instance store for mission-critical workloads.
Option (C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance is not a good choice because Amazon S3 does not have the same level of performance as an instance store for mission-critical workloads. While Amazon S3 can be used to store backup data, it may not provide the same level of performance as an instance store for mission-critical workloads.
Therefore, the best answer is (D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance.
