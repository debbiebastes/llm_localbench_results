A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
Explanation:
When using Reserved EC2 instances, you pay an upfront fee to secure the instance and the cost of usage is lowered significantly over a fixed period of time. The most cost-effective option in this case would be to purchase a 3-year Standard Reserved Instance, which offers a discounted price compared to On-Demand instances while still providing flexibility in terms of instance selection and region availability.
Option (A) provides the highest upfront savings but locks you into a single instance type for the entire term, limiting flexibility. Option (B) offers no upfront payment option but does provide the lowest usage cost over the 3-year term, which may not be enough of a savings to justify the lack of upfront payment.
Option (D) provides the most flexibility with renewable terms each year but incurs the highest usage costs per year, which could result in higher overall costs over the 3-year term.
