The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is option (C): Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances, and set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
Here's why:
AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager makes it easy to deploy patches to multiple EC2 instances at once, without having to manually update each instance individually. This can help mitigate the security risk quickly and efficiently.
Additionally, AWS Config allows you to track any configuration changes made through AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, providing a record of all patches applied and associated compliance statuses for audit purposes.
Option (A) does not provide as comprehensive a solution as option (C), as it only integrates Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, without providing any patch management capabilities.
Option (B) sets up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches, but does not provide any additional recording or tracking of configuration changes.
Option (D) is not a feasible solution as it would require manual intervention to install patches on a weekly basis, rather than automating the process through AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager.
