A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (B) The endpoint request timed-out.

When a Lambda function is invoked through an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration, it can take some time for the function to complete its execution. If the request times out before the function completes, the response will be returned with a 502 Bad Gateway error. This error indicates that the server timing out while waiting for a response from the Lambda function.
Option (B) The endpoint request timed-out is the most likely root cause of this issue because it aligns with the symptoms described in the question. The developer received a 502 Bad Gateway error, which indicates that the server timed out while waiting for a response from the Lambda function.
