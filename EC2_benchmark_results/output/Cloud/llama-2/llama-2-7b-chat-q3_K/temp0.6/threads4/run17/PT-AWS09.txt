A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
API Gateway provides built-in support for handling traffic spikes through its ability to throttle requests based on various criteria, such as IP address, user agent, or HTTP headers. By enabling throttling limits, you can set a limit on the number of requests that can be made from a particular IP address within a given time period, helping to prevent the backend systems from becoming overwhelmed.
Additionally, API Gateway provides result caching, which allows you to cache the results of API calls so that they can be served to subsequent requests instead of making new requests to the backend systems. This can help reduce the load on the backend systems and improve overall performance during traffic spikes.
