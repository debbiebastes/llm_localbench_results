The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is option (C): Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances, and set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
Here's why:
Option (A) requires using Amazon QuickSight with Kibana, which may not be necessary in this scenario. Option (B) involves setting up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches, but it does not provide a way to record and track any configuration changes. Option (D) is a manual solution that requires configuring the EC2 instances to automatically install patches on a weekly basis, which may not be practical or efficient in this scenario.
Option (C), however, provides a comprehensive solution by using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances, and setting up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes. This allows the IT Security team to quickly and efficiently mitigate the security risk associated with the vulnerable operating systems, while also maintaining compliance records for audit purposes.
