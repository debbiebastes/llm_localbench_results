An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
Here's why:
An EBS volume provides persistent block storage, which is ideal for mission-critical workloads. By attaching an EBS volume to your EC2 instance, you can ensure that your data is persistently stored and available even in the event of a failure or instance termination.
Storing your backup data in Amazon S3 is also a good choice because it provides a highly durable and scalable storage solution. You can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which will help reduce storage costs and improve data retention.
Option (A) is not the best choice because instance store volumes are designed for temporary storage and do not provide persistent storage. Option (C) is also not a good choice because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a storage service that is optimized for low-latency access, rather than long-term archiving.
Option (D) is incorrect because instance store volumes are designed for temporary storage and do not provide persistent storage.
