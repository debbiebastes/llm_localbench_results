A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is option (A): Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, and associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
AWS Config allows you to automate the configuration of AWS resources, including security groups. By using AWS Config rules, you can configure AWS Lambda functions to automatically detect when a security group allows inbound traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach is efficient because it automates the remediation process without requiring manual intervention.
Option (B) setting up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and EC2 instances is not an efficient solution for remediating this security risk because it requires additional infrastructure and configuration, which can be time-consuming and costly.
Option (C) blocking the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL is not a suitable solution for remediation because it only prevents new traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but does not automatically update the security groups to allow traffic from the corporate firewall.
Option (D) using AWS Shield to monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range is not a suitable solution for remediation because it only provides real-time monitoring of security groups, but does not automate the remediation process.
