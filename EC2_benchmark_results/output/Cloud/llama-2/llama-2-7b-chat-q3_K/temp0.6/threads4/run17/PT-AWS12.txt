A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:
If the application being hosted will be used for more than 3 years, option (C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term is the most cost-effective option. This is because Reserved Instances provide a discount of up to 75% compared to On-Demand EC2 instances, and using a 3-year term will allow you to take advantage of this discount for the longest possible period.
Option (A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term is not the most cost-effective option because it provides a lower discount compared to the standard Reserved Instances, and it has a shorter term length of 1 year.
Option (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term is also not the most cost-effective option because it does not provide any discount compared to On-Demand EC2 instances, and it has a longer term length of 3 years.
Option (D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year is also not the most cost-effective option because it does not provide any discount compared to On-Demand EC2 instances, and it has a shorter term length of 1 year.
