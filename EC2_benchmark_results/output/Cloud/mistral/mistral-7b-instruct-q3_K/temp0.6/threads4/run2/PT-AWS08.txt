An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (A). 
Option A is the best choice as it provides a persistent block storage volume that can be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in Amazon S3, which provides high durability and reliability. Additionally, using an instance store volume provides faster IOPS than using EBS volumes, making it suitable for mission-critical workloads. Finally, the use of lifecycle policies to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier ensures cost optimization by moving data to a lower-cost storage service after 30 days.
