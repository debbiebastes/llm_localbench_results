An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

If you need persistent block storage, it is best to attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance since EBS volumes can be attached to running instances but cannot be moved between instances once they are created. Also, EBS volumes have a maximum size of 1 TB, which may not be enough for mission-critical workloads that require large amounts of storage.

For the backup data, Amazon S3 is a suitable choice since it provides durable and reliable object storage with high availability. You can store your backup data in an S3 bucket and configure lifecycle policies to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. This will help you save on storage costs while still keeping your data available for retrieval when needed.
