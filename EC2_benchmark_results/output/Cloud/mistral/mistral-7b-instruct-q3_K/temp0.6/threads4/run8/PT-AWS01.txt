A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

To comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of storing sensitive PII in an Amazon S3 bucket, the Security Engineer should implement the (B) option, which is implementing an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This encryption technique provides end-to-end encryption from the client to the server, and the keys are managed by AWS KMS, which complies with numerous regulations such as HIPAA. The customer master key is never exposed to AWS, ensuring that the PII remains secure at all times.
