Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The optimal number of EC2 instances for processing four Kinesis shards is two. Therefore, when you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six, the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance would be 6. Answer (C)
