A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling. 

The best way to protect backend systems from traffic spikes is by switching to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), and Auto Scaling. This will allow the platform to handle sudden spikes in traffic without any downtime or performance degradation. Additionally, this will provide better control over resources and enable automatic scaling based on demand.

API Gateway is a great tool for building APIs but it has its limitations when it comes to handling sudden spikes in traffic. Throttling limits and result caching can help mitigate some of the load, but they may not be sufficient to handle extreme traffic surges. CloudFront can also act as a cache, but it is not always necessary for protecting backend systems from traffic spikes.

Moving the Lambda function in a VPC will not provide any scalability or availability benefits in this scenario.
