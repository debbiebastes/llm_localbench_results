A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years is (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option allows for the flexibility of paying for only the instances that are used during the 3-year period and avoids upfront costs. Additionally, convertible reserved instances offer lower upfront costs compared to standard reserved instances and have the added benefit of being able to be converted into on-demand instances if needed in the future.
