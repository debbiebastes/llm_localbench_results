A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 

The MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements is (C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

EventBridge provides an easy way to capture events from multiple AWS services, including DynamoDB. This would enable the developer to track all changes made to the items in the first DynamoDB table and automatically process these changes using a Lambda function. The Lambda function would then save the new changes to the other DynamoDB table in another region, ensuring that the application remains compliant with the IT requirements.

Option (B) would be a good solution as well, as it enables point-in-time recovery of data and can help track changes made to items in DynamoDB tables over time. However, it might not be as scalable or flexible as using EventBridge with a Lambda function.

Option (A) is not suitable for this scenario because DynamoDB Accelerator is a service that helps optimize and accelerate the performance of DynamoDB applications. It does not provide the necessary functionality to track changes made to items in DynamoDB tables or ensure compliance with IT requirements.

Option (D) is also not suitable for this scenario because DynamoDB Streams are optimized for real-time data processing and might not be the best solution for tracking changes made to items in DynamoDB tables over time.
