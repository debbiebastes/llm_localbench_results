Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
Option (B) - With four shards and one KCL worker, you have one instance per shard. So, the total number of instances needed to process the data is equal to the number of shards. Adding more shards would require additional instances, but each instance can process only one shard at a time, so adding more instances will not improve performance beyond the limit set by the number of shards. Therefore, the maximum number of EC2 instances needed for optimum performance is equal to the current number of shards, which is six.
