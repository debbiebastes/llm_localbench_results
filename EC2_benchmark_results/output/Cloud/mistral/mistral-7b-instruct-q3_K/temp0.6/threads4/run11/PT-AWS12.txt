A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

The most cost-effective option for the company would be (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option offers no upfront costs, which can help to reduce initial expenses, and also provides more flexibility than other reserved instance options as it allows for the instance to be converted to an On-Demand or Spot EC2 instance at any time within the 3-year term. Additionally, this option is specifically designed for applications that are used consistently over a long period of time, making it an ideal choice for a company planning to migrate their application to a reserved EC2 instance for more than 3 years.
