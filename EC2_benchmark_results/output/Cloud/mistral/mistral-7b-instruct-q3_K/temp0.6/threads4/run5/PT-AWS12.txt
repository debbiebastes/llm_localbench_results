A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation: The most cost-effective option would be to choose a Convertible reserved instance with no upfront cost for a 3-year term, which would provide the most significant discount on usage and allow for flexibility in terms of instance type changes. This option is more cost-effective than committing to a fixed instance type upfront or paying all at once for a Reserved Instance.
