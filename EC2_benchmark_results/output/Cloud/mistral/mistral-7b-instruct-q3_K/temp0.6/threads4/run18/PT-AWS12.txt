A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

The most cost-effective option would be B - No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. 

This option does not require any upfront payment and offers a lower cost per hour compared to the other options. Additionally, it provides greater flexibility in terms of being able to modify or cancel the instance at any time during the 3-year period. This makes it the most cost-effective option for an application that will be used for more than 3 years.
