A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

The best way to protect the backend systems from traffic spikes is by using option (A). By switching from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling, the platform can handle an increase in traffic without compromising on performance or availability. Option (A) provides greater control and flexibility over scaling, load balancing, and fault tolerance, making it the most suitable option for handling sudden spikes in traffic.

Option (B), although useful for managing traffic limits and reducing response times, may not be sufficient to handle sudden spikes in traffic, especially if there is a significant increase in users. Option (C) can help with caching and reducing response times, but it may not provide the same level of control and scalability as using EC2 instances and Auto Scaling. Lastly, moving the Lambda function to a VPC can be useful for security and network isolation, but it does not address the issue of handling traffic spikes.
