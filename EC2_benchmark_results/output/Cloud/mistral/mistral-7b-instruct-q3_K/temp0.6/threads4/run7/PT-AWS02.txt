The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
Option C is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario. Using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances and also setting up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes is the best way to mitigate the security risk while keeping a record of all updates made for compliance purposes. Option A and B are good solutions but lacks the automatic patching feature that is essential in this scenario. Option D will require manual intervention on a weekly basis which may not be efficient in terms of security management.
