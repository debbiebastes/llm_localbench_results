An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

The answer is not provided as it depends on the specific requirements of the organization. However, based on the information given, Option (A) might be the most appropriate as it uses an instance store volume which provides persistent block storage that can be accessed by a single EC2 instance and provides low-latency IOPS performance. Additionally, using Amazon S3 for backup data is a good choice as it provides durable, highly available, and scalable object storage, and S3 Glacier can be used to store data that needs to be retrieved less than once per year.
