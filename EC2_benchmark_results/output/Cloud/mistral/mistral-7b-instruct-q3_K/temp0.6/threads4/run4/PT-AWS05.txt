A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
The most ideal way to comply with the requirements would be option (C). Setting up Amazon EventBridge and creating a Lambda function as a rule target will ensure that any changes made to the items in DynamoDB are automatically recorded and saved in the other DynamoDB table. This solution provides fine-grained control over the events captured, allowing for better compliance and monitoring of the system. Additionally, it is serverless, which means that there are no infrastructure costs associated with maintaining this solution.
