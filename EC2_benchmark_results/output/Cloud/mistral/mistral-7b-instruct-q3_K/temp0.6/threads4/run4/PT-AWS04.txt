Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12 

Explanation: 

With six shards, each instance can process one shard. Therefore, the total number of instances needed to process all six shards is six. Hence, you should launch twelve EC2 instances to achieve optimum performance for your application.
