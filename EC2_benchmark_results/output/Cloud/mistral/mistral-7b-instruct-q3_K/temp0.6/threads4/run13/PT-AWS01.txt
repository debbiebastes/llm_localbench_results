A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

The recommended solution would be (A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key. This technique allows the Security Engineer to encrypt data on the client-side before sending it to S3, which ensures that the data is never sent in plaintext to AWS. The encryption keys are stored locally on the client device and are not sent to AWS. Additionally, using Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a customer master key provides an extra layer of security by ensuring that only authorized personnel who have access to the private key can decrypt the data.
