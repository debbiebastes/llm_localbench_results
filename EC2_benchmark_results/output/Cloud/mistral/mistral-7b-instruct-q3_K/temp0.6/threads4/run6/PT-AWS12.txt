A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

Option (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years. This is because it offers the lowest upfront cost, and allows for flexibility in terms of renewal terms and payment options. Additionally, the On-Demand pricing may not be as low in the long run as Reserved Instance pricing, especially for applications that are highly utilized.
