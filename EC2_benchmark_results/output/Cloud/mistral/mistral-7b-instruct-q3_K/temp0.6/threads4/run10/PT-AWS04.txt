Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12

Explanation:

To determine the maximum number of EC2 instances needed for optimal performance, we need to consider how many instances are required to distribute the load across all six shards. Since each instance can handle one KCL worker, we will need enough instances to cover six workers. 

So, we would need a total of 6 instances (one per worker). However, this assumes that each instance can only handle one KCL worker, which may not be the case in practice. If each instance can handle more than one worker, then the number of instances needed will be lower. Similarly, if each instance can only handle one shard, then the number of instances needed will be higher.

Therefore, the exact number of EC2 instances required for optimal performance will depend on the specific details of your application and how it is configured.
