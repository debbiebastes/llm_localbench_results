Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
The best option to scale up your application for processing a Kinesis data stream would be option B, which is 12 EC2 instances. This is because the number of open shards determines the maximum number of simultaneous read and write operations that can be processed on the stream. If you have more open shards, then you can handle more data as well as more data ingestion and egress rates.
