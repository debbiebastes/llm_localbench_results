An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

The correct option is (C). Attaching an EBS volume in your EC2 instance will provide persistent block storage for mission-critical workloads. Using Amazon S3 to store backup data and configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA after 30 days will meet the requirement of storing data in a data archiving storage service. Option (A) is incorrect because an instance store volume is not persistent across EC2 instance terminations or upgrades. Option (B) is also incorrect as it uses Amazon S3 Glacier instead of One Zone-IA for archival storage which is less cost effective for infrequently accessed data. Option (D) is incorrect because Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a data archiving storage service, but rather an infrequent access storage class that provides lower retrieval times and higher latency than Amazon S3 Glacier.
