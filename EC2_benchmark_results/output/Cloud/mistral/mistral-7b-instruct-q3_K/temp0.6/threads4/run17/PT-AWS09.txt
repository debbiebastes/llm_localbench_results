A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
A, B and C are all good options to protect the backend systems from traffic spikes. However, using EC2 instances, ELB and Auto Scaling is the best option as it provides horizontal scaling capabilities which can handle sudden surge of traffic without any performance issues. Additionally, enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway will help in managing the load on the backend systems while ensuring that the response times are fast. Finally, using CloudFront to cache the responses will further improve the overall performance of the system by reducing the number of requests going to the backend servers.
