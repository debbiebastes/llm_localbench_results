A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 
The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (A) there is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend. This can occur if the Lambda function returns an output format that is not compatible with the expected format defined in the API Gateway integration settings. The developer should check the Lambda function to ensure it returns the expected output format, such as JSON or XML. If necessary, she may need to modify the Lambda function code to return the expected format.
