Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12

Explanation:

With six shards in the data stream and each instance having one KCL worker, you need to launch at least six EC2 instances. 

However, since you want to optimize performance, you should also launch more instances than the number of shards. This is because each instance can handle multiple shards simultaneously, allowing for increased processing power and throughput. 

Therefore, if you want to achieve optimum performance, you should launch 12 EC2 instances (six instances per shard).
