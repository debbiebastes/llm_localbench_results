An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

The best solution to meet the requirement is (C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA. 

Here's why:

* Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides persistent block storage volumes for EC2 instances, which makes it ideal for mission-critical workloads. 
* Amazon S3 is a highly scalable and durable object storage service that is designed to store large amounts of data indefinitely. It also supports lifecycle policies that allow you to transition your objects between different storage classes based on their access frequency.
* Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is the most cost-effective storage class for storing infrequently accessed data in a single region. It has a retrieval time of several minutes and is suitable for use cases where retrieval latency isn't critical.
* Attaching an EBS volume to your EC2 instance allows you to create a persistent block storage environment that can be used for mission-critical workloads, while using Amazon S3 as the backup storage solution provides scalability, durability, and cost efficiency.
