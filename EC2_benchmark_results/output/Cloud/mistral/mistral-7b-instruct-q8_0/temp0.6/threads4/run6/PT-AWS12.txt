A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

The most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years, would be (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

This option allows for no upfront costs and a lower monthly payment compared to the other options. Additionally, since the reserved instances are convertible, if the usage decreases or stops, the company can easily switch back to On-Demand pricing without any additional fees or penalties.
