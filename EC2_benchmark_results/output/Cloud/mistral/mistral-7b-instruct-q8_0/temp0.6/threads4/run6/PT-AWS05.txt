A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 

The MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements is (C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation:

Option C provides a comprehensive approach to compliance by capturing all changes made to the items in DynamoDB, providing real-time visibility of those changes, and allowing for automated processing and storage of the data in another DynamoDB table in another region. By using EventBridge, you can easily track and monitor table-level events, ensuring that any new changes are captured and recorded as required. This approach also allows for more granular control over the data being processed and stored, giving you greater flexibility and customization options.
