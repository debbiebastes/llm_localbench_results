A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 

All of the above options are good choices to protect the backend systems from traffic spikes, but the best option would be to switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling. This option will provide more control over the resources that can be allocated to handle the expected increased traffic, making it more reliable and able to handle sudden spikes in traffic without performance issues.

Option B can help reduce response times and improve performance by enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway. Option C can also improve performance by using CloudFront as a cache in front of the API Gateway, but it may not be enough to handle sudden spikes in traffic. Option D moving the Lambda function in a VPC will also help with performance, but it will not provide the level of control and scalability that EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling can offer.
