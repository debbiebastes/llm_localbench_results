Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

D. 6 

Scaling up a Kinesis data stream by adding shards will distribute the load among more instances, but it is important to ensure that each instance has enough capacity to handle its share of data. Since you already have one worker per instance and you're adding two more shards, you can launch six EC2 instances in total.

Additionally, it's worth considering the possibility of using Kinesis Data Firehose as a destination for your stream. This service can automatically scale up or down based on the volume of data coming in, and can be used to send data to various types of destinations such as Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch, and more.
