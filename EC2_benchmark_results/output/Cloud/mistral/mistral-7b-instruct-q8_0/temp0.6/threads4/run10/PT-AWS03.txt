A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:

AWS Config is a service that helps you monitor changes in your AWS infrastructure, such as changes made to IAM roles, EC2 instances, and security groups. By using AWS Config rules, we can create automated alarms for any changes made to our infrastructure that could affect our security posture. 

In this case, we can create an AWS Config rule that automatically detects whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Once the rule detects such a change, it can trigger an AWS Lambda function that will run a Systems Manager Automation document to update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Using this approach, we ensure that all traffic passes through our existing corporate firewall, while also preventing developers from making unauthorized changes to our infrastructure. This is the most efficient and effective way to remediate this security risk as it provides automated monitoring and enforcement of our security policies.
