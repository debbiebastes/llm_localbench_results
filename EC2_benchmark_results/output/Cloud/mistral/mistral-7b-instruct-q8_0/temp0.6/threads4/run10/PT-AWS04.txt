Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12

When you reshard your Kinesis data stream, the number of shards is increased, which means that more instances need to be launched to process the data. The optimal way to achieve optimum performance is to launch as many EC2 instances as there are open shards in the stream. Since the number of open shards is six, you should launch 12 instances to ensure that each instance has one worker per shard. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 12.
