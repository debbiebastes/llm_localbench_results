An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

Since the block storage volume will be used for mission-critical workloads, it is important that the data is stored on a persistent storage device such as an EBS volume. This ensures that even if the instance is stopped and restarted, the data will still be available. 

Amazon S3 can be used to store the backup data, and Amazon S3 Glacier can be configured to transition the objects after 30 days. This meets the requirement of storing the data for 30 days before moving it to an archiving storage service. 

It is important to note that Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is not a suitable option as it provides only 99.5% durability and may not be sufficient for mission-critical workloads.
