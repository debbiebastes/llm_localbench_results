A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

Option (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years. This option provides the lowest upfront cost and allows for significant savings over time by utilizing reserved instances without the need to pay for unused capacity. Additionally, the convertibility feature of the reserved instance ensures that if the usage patterns change in the future, the instance can be converted into an on-demand instance at no additional cost.
