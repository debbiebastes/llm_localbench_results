Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12

To calculate the number of EC2 instances required for optimum performance, you need to consider several factors such as CPU and memory utilization, network bandwidth, disk I/O, etc. Based on these factors, you can determine that launching 6 EC2 instances would not be enough to handle the increased workload of 6 shards.

To achieve optimum performance, you would need to calculate the required number of worker instances based on the CPU and memory utilization of each instance. For example, if one KCL worker instance requires 0.5 vCPU and 1 GB of memory, then launching 24 instances with 1 vCPU and 2 GB of memory each would provide optimal performance.

Therefore, you should launch 12 instances to achieve optimum performance for your application.
