Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

To achieve optimal performance, you need to launch an EC2 instance for each open shard in your Kinesis data stream. Since you resharded your stream to six shards, you should launch a total of six instances. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
