The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the company’s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

The MOST suitable solution in this scenario would be option (C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.

AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager is a service that automates patch management for EC2 instances, making it easy to patch systems without having to manually connect to each instance. This would be the most efficient way to quickly deploy patches to the outdated EC2 instances. AWS Config also records and tracks any configuration changes made to the instances, providing an audit trail for compliance purposes.

Option (D) configuring the EC2 instances to automatically install OS patches on a weekly basis is not recommended as it may cause disruption to the company’s applications and could lead to further security risks if the patches are not tested properly before deployment.
