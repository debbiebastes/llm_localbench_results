A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
AWS Security Best Practices recommends using client-side encryption to keep the data encrypted in transit and at rest. This can be done by implementing Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key. The client-side master key is used to encrypt the data before it is sent to AWS, ensuring that only authorized clients can read the data. It also provides better control over the keys, as they are not stored in AWS.
