Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12

Explanation:
To achieve optimum performance, you need to launch one KCL worker for each shard. Since you have six open shards, you should launch 6 EC2 instances, with one KCL worker per instance. This will ensure that all data is processed efficiently and quickly. Therefore, the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch is 12.
