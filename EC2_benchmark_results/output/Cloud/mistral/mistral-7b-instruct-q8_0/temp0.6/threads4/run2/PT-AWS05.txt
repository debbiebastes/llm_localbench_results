A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 

The MOST ideal way to comply with this requirement is (C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

This solution has several benefits:

1. It allows for granular control over the data being recorded, as each item update in one table can trigger a specific Lambda function to modify an entry in another table.
2. The solution is highly scalable, as it does not require any manual setup or management of DynamoDB tables.
3. The solution is cost-effective, as it leverages existing services such as DynamoDB and Lambda to accomplish compliance requirements without requiring additional infrastructure or services.
