A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
A. Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key. 

Implementing client-side encryption is the best choice as it encrypts data on the client side before sending it to the S3 bucket, and the master key never leaves the client. This ensures that the sensitive PII is kept secure and compliant with regulatory requirements. Additionally, using an Amazon KMS managed customer master key adds an extra layer of security and control over the encryption process.
