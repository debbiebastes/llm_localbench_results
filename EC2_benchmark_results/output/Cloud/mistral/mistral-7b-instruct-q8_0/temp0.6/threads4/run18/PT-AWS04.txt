Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(B) 12

The number of KCL workers that can be launched in an instance is determined by the available CPU and memory resources. Since each worker can handle a single shard, you would need to launch one worker per open shard to ensure optimum performance. With six shards, you would need to launch 6 worker instances.

However, there may be other factors that could impact the performance of your application, such as network latency and I/O bottlenecks. It's also worth noting that adding more workers can increase costs, so it's important to balance performance and cost efficiency when scaling up your application.
