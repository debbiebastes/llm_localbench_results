A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

The most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk is (A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:
Option A is the most efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk because it uses AWS Config rules to automatically detect and enforce compliance with company policy. This approach ensures that all changes to security groups are tracked, audited, and tested for compliance before they can be applied. By associating a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule, you can automate the remediation process and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address, which will prevent any unauthorized traffic from reaching the EC2 instances. This approach provides a scalable, secure, and efficient solution to manage security group configuration changes across multiple resources in an AWS environment.
