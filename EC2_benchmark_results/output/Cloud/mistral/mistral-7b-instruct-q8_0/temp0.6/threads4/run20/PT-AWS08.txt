An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier. 

Explanation: 

For mission-critical workloads, it is recommended to use a persistent block storage volume, such as an EBS volume, rather than an instance-store volume. However, since the organization requires a persistent block storage volume and the data needs to be stored in different storage services based on its age, an instance store volume may be more appropriate. 

In this case, option (A) is the correct choice as it provides a persistent block storage volume using an EBS volume, which can be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data can be stored in Amazon S3 and configured with a lifecycle policy to transition the objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. This will ensure that the data is stored in a cost-effective and secure manner based on its age.
