Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

To achieve optimum performance, the number of EC2 instances that you should launch is equal to the total number of open shards in your Kinesis data stream. In this case, there are six open shards, so you should launch six instances with one KCL worker each.

Hence, the correct answer is:

(D) 6
