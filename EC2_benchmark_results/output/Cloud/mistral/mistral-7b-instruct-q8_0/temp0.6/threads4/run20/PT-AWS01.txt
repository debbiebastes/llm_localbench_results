A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

To comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the hospital, the Security Engineer should implement (B) Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This technique provides end-to-end encryption using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). The data is encrypted at rest in the S3 bucket and can be decrypted only by authorized users who have the correct key. The hospital can also implement additional security measures such as IAM policies and access controls to further secure the PII stored in the S3 bucket.
