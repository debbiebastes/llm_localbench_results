The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The most suitable solution in this scenario is (C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes. 

AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager is a service that helps automate the patching of your Amazon EC2 instances. It can be used to identify unpatched applications, automatically apply patches, and schedule recurring maintenance tasks. This solution provides a centralized management console that allows you to view the status of all patches and remediation actions in one place.

By using AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes, the IT Security team can ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations such as HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR. This solution also provides a detailed audit trail that can be used for forensic purposes and incident response.
