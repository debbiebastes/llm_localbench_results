A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

The correct answer would be (B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This is because the Security Engineer should ensure that only authorized parties can access and manage the PII, and this technique allows them to control the encryption keys on their own while still benefiting from AWS's secure infrastructure. Additionally, implementing client-side encryption ensures that data remains encrypted until it reaches its intended destination in S3.
