Answer: 

The security perspective would be the most essential for the company’s migration. 

With the migration to AWS, the company needs to ensure that its data is secure and protected from unauthorized access or attacks. The security perspective of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework provides guidance on how to implement security controls in the cloud environment, such as identity and access management, encryption, network security, and compliance with industry standards. 

Implementing these security measures will help the company protect its data and ensure compliance with regulations, which is essential for any e-commerce business. Additionally, a secure cloud infrastructure will enhance customer trust, reduce risks, and improve overall business performance.
