A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation: The Security Engineer should implement Amazon S3 client-side encryption using KMS-managed customer master keys to protect the sensitive PII data stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. This is because it ensures that the master key and unencrypted data are never sent to AWS, and the data remains secure even if the S3 server or application is compromised. Additionally, KMS manages the master keys, providing an extra layer of security for the data.
