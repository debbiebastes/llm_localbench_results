The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:

(A) AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager allows you to manage sessions across multiple EC2 instances, making it a convenient solution for deploying patches and recording configuration changes. It also provides the ability to monitor and control access to your instances, ensuring that only authorized personnel can make changes.

Amazon QuickSight is a data visualization service that can be integrated with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes made to the EC2 instances. This integration allows for easy monitoring of the status of all patches and compliance statuses.

(B) While AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager provides an automated solution for patching EC2 instances, it does not provide the ability to integrate with Kibana or QuickSight. This makes it more difficult to track changes made to the EC2 instances and monitor compliance statuses.

(C) Although AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager is an effective tool for deploying patches, it does not automatically record configuration changes. Additionally, AWS Config can be more complex to set up than other solutions, making it less suitable in this scenario.

(D) While automating the patch process is important, it does not address the need to record and track any configuration changes made to the EC2 instances. This is crucial for ensuring compliance with various regulations.
