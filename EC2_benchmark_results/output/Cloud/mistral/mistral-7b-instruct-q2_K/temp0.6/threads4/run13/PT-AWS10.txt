Which of the following AWS Cloud Adoption Framework perspective would be the most essential for the companyâ€™s migration?

(A) Security Perspective
(B) Governance Perspective

(D) Platform Perspective

Answer: 

The most essential perspective for a secure and efficient migration of the e-commerce company's on-premise infrastructure to Amazon Web Services would be the "Governance Perspective". This perspective focuses on ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, as well as establishing policies and procedures to manage the deployment, configuration, and operation of workloads in a consistent and controlled manner. It is critical to ensure that any migration to AWS is done in a way that adheres to relevant regulations and standards, and does not expose the company to any unnecessary security risks or compliance violations.
