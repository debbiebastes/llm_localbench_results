An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The correct answer is (A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier. 

Explanation: An instance store volume provides persistent block storage for an Amazon EC2 instance. It is suitable for workloads that require low latency, high I/O performance, and high durability. The backup data can be stored in Amazon S3 using the lifecycle policy to move your data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days. This will help you reduce storage costs while maintaining data availability and durability. Option (D) is incorrect because it suggests using Amazon S3 One Zone-IA, which is a cold storage storage class that does not provide the same level of performance and durability as Amazon S3 Glacier.
