A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

The correct option would be (B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This is because the hospital needs to comply with strict compliance and regulatory requirements that prevent sensitive data from being stored in the cloud, even if encrypted. By using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage their own master keys, the hospital can ensure that their data remains compliant with these regulations while still taking advantage of the scalability and reliability benefits of AWS.
