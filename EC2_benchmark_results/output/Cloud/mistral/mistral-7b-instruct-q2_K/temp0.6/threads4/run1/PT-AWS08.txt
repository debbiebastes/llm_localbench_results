An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:
An instance storage volume provides fast, low-latency access to frequently accessed data, making it suitable for mission-critical workloads. For the primary block storage volume, an instance store volume is the best option because of its high performance and persistent nature. 
On the other hand, Amazon S3 provides durable object storage that can be used for backup and archiving purposes. It is ideal for storing large amounts of data infrequently accessed, and it provides a cost-effective solution for long-term data storage. To meet the requirement, you need to attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance and use Amazon S3 to store your backup data. Additionally, you can configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, which is more cost-effective than storing data in Amazon S3 Standard tier.
