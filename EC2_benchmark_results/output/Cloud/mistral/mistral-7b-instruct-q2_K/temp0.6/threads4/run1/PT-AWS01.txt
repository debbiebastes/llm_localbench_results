A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation: 
Implementing an S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key provides both end-to-end encryption and key management of PII data stored in the S3 bucket. The client-side encryption ensures that only authorized users can access the data, while the KMS-managed master key provides an additional layer of security by encrypting the client-side master key. This technique also meets regulatory compliance requirements as it allows for strict control over the management of keys and data.
