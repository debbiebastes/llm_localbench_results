A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

The most cost-effective option would be (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This option offers the lowest total cost over three years, as it does not require an upfront payment and allows for the instance to be converted to a pay-as-you-go On-Demand instance when no longer needed. Option (A) may seem like the cheapest option initially, but requires an upfront payment and limits flexibility in case the application's needs change over time. Option (C) would require a significant upfront investment and does not provide any flexibility. Option (D) would provide more flexibility but also requires an upfront payment and may end up costing more than option (B) over three years.
