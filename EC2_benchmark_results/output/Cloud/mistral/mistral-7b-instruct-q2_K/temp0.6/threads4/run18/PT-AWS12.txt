A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation:

For the application to be cost-effective, we need to compare the cost of running it on an On-Demand EC2 instance versus a Reserved Instance.

The All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term is relatively more expensive than the No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term because you are paying upfront for a longer period. Therefore, option (A) would not be the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years.

Option (C) is also relatively more expensive than option (B), as it requires an upfront payment of the entire 3-year term. However, this option may still be cheaper than option (A) in terms of long-term costs. Therefore, option (C) is also not the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years.

Option (D) allows you to pay only for what you use in a 1-year period, and then renew your instance each year. This option would only be beneficial if the usage of the application fluctuates significantly from year to year.

Therefore, the most cost-effective option for running an application on AWS for more than 3 years would be option (B) - No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
