Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(B) 12

Explanation:
The optimal number of instances to launch depends on the number of open shards and the resources available on each instance. If you have six shards and each shard requires one KCL worker, then you would need a minimum of 6 instances to handle all the shards. However, if you want to achieve optimum performance, you should launch as many instances as possible without exceeding the maximum number of EC2 instances allowed by your AWS account.

In this case, if you can launch up to 10 instances, then you should launch all 10 instances to maximize performance. This will ensure that each instance is handling an equal amount of data and processing power is distributed evenly across all instances. However, it's important to note that launching too many instances may not necessarily result in better performance, as there may be network latency issues and other bottlenecks.

So, the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances to achieve optimum performance would depend on the resources available and the number of open shards, but for this specific scenario with 6 shards, you should launch up to 10 instances.
