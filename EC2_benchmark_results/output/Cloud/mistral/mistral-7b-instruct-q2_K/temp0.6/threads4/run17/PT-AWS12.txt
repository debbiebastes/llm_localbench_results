(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

Option B, No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term, would be the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years. This option offers the lowest cost for a longer duration of commitment and allows flexibility to reduce or increase instances as needed without incurring additional costs upfront.
