The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation: 
Option (A) is the most suitable solution for this scenario as it provides a comprehensive approach to patch management, configuration tracking, and audit purposes. AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager can quickly and easily deploy the OS patches to the outdated EC2 instances while Amazon QuickSight with Kibana can provide detailed records of the changes made, including when they were made, who made them, and any associated compliance statuses. Additionally, this solution is highly scalable, meaning it can be easily applied to a large number of EC2 instances without extensive manual intervention. 
Option (B) provides similar capabilities as Option (A), but with less integration with Amazon QuickSight. This could make it more difficult to track configuration changes and compliance statuses over time.
Option (C) also provides patch management, but lacks the integration with AWS Config for configuration tracking and audit purposes. 
Option (D) is not a suitable solution as it only automates the patch deployment process and does not provide any means of recording or tracking configuration changes.
