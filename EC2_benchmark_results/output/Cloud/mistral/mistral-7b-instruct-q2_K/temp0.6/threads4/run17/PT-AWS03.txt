A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
A Security Engineer should use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:
Option (A) is the most efficient way to remediate this security risk because it automates the process of detecting, updating, and enforcing security policies across multiple resources. AWS Config provides a centralized repository for storing and managing configuration data across your AWS resources. The AWS Config rule can be used to monitor changes to security groups and automatically trigger an AWS Lambda function to update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. Option (A) is also scalable, as it can be applied to all security groups in the organization without requiring manual intervention.
Option (B) requires additional setup and configuration, and may not provide the same level of granularity and control as using AWS Config rules and AWS Lambda functions.
Option (C) only blocks traffic from a specific source IP address, and does not address other security risks or vulnerabilities.
Option (D) may not be necessary, as it is generally recommended to use network security groups for controlling inbound and outbound traffic, rather than using AWS Shield.
