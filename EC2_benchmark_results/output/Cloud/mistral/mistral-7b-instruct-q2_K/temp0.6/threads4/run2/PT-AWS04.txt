Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12 

The optimal number of EC2 instances for a Kinesis stream depends on several factors such as the amount of data that needs to be processed, the processing power required, and the available resources. In this case, if you reshard your Kinesis stream to six shards, then each instance will process one-sixth of the total number of records. 

To achieve optimum performance, you should launch 12 EC2 instances, as each instance can process one-sixth of the total number of records. This will ensure that your application processes all the data in a timely and efficient manner.
