A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS-managed key.

Explanation: 

To comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company, it is important to ensure that PII is encrypted both in transit and at rest. 

Option (A), Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key, does not meet the requirement as the unencrypted data is sent to AWS for processing, which means that the data is not fully encrypted at rest. 

Option (B) Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key, also does not meet the requirements as the unencrypted data is still sent to AWS for processing. 

Option (D) Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a customer provided key, does not provide any additional security as it is still sending the unencrypted data to AWS. 

Therefore, the recommended option would be to implement Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS-managed key, which will ensure that PII is fully encrypted both in transit and at rest while also complying with regulatory requirements.
