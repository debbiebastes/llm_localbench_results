A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 

The MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk would be (A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation: 

Option (A) is the most efficient way because it uses a combination of AWS Config and Systems Manager Automation documents to automatically detect and remediate the issue. This solution also ensures that only traffic from approved sources, such as the corporate firewall, is allowed inbound to the EC2 instances. By using AWS Config rules, this solution can continuously monitor for changes to security groups and automatically trigger an automation document to update them with the correct settings.

Option (B) is not an efficient solution because it requires additional infrastructure setup, such as a VPC transit connection between the corporate firewall and EC2 instances. This option also does not provide any way to detect and remediate the issue automatically.

Option (C) is a possible solution but it requires manual configuration of Network ACLs to block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. This option also does not provide any way to detect and remediate other security groups that may allow traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Option (D) is also a possible solution but it requires additional configuration of AWS Shield to monitor for all incoming traffic that directly originates from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, which can be resource-intensive and may require significant setup time. This option also does not provide any way to automatically remediate the issue or update security groups with the correct settings.
