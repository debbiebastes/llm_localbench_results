A Security Engineer has found out that there are some developers who have been adding rules to security groups without any approval. The developers configured the security groups to allow RDS, SMTP, and SSH traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range in order to do their code testing. The company has an existing firewall hosted in an EC2 instance where all of the traffic should pass through.

Which of the following is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk?

(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.
(B) Set up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances.
(C) Block the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL.
(D) Use AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all the security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.

Answer: 
(A) Use AWS Config rules to automatically detect whether there is a security group that allows inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Associate a Systems Manager Automation document with an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to remediate and update the security group with the corporate firewall IP address.

Explanation:
Option (A) is the MOST efficient way to automatically remediate this security risk. It involves using AWS Config rules to monitor and detect whether there are any security groups that allow inbound TCP or UDP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range. Once a security group that matches this criteria is found, an AWS Lambda function can be executed to automatically remediate the issue by updating the security group with the corporate firewall IP address. This approach allows for continuous monitoring and automated remediation of security risks, making it the most efficient solution. Option (B) involves setting up a Transit VPC to connect the corporate firewall and the EC2 instances, but this approach does not directly address the security risk at hand. Option (C) involves blocking the source IP addresses coming from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range using Network ACL, but this approach only blocks traffic that matches specific criteria and may not catch all potential security risks. Finally, option (D) uses AWS Shield to automatically monitor and detect all security groups that allow traffic directly from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range, but this option may not be necessary in this specific scenario as the security group in question only allows traffic from the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range.
