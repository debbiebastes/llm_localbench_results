A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

The most cost-effective option would be (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. 

Explanation: 

If the application being hosted will be used for more than 3 years, then using a Reserved EC2 instance can provide significant cost savings compared to On-Demand pricing. However, it is important to note that there are two types of Reserved Instances available on AWS - Convertible and Standard. 

Convertible instances allow you to switch between an On-Demand and Spot Instance at any time during the term, making them a more flexible option for applications with varying workloads. However, they come with a higher upfront cost compared to Standard instances. 

On the other hand, Standard Reserved Instances provide significant discounts for applications that have consistent workloads over an extended period. They require a higher initial commitment than Convertible instances but offer a lower hourly rate that can be advantageous for longer-term workloads. 

In this scenario, since the application will be used for more than 3 years, using a No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term would be the most cost-effective option as it provides flexibility and lower upfront costs compared to All Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
