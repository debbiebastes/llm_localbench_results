A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.

This is because using EC2 instances can provide better performance and availability for the backend systems than using AWS Lambda. ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) can distribute traffic across multiple instances, providing high availability and scalability. Additionally, Auto Scaling can automatically scale up or down based on the incoming traffic to ensure that the platform remains responsive. By switching from a serverless architecture to an infrastructure-based architecture, the platform will be better prepared to handle traffic spikes during price surges of cryptocurrencies.
