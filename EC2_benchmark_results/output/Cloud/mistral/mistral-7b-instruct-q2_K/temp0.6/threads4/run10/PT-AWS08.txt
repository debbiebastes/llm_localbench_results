An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

The correct answer is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:

For mission-critical workloads, it is recommended to use an EBS volume instead of an instance store volume since EBS volumes provide persistent block storage that can be accessed even if the EC2 instance is stopped or terminated.

In addition, for backup data, Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is a good option as it provides long-term storage with lower costs than other S3 storage classes. This option is suitable for infrequently accessed data that needs to be stored for an extended period of time.

Finally, Amazon S3 Glacier is a good choice for data archiving since it is designed for long-term storage and retrieval of infrequently accessed data. The data can be easily retrieved from Glacier when needed.
