A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
Option (B): Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation: The Security Engineer should ensure that the PII is encrypted using strong encryption techniques before storing it in the Amazon S3 bucket to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. Option (B) provides end-to-end encryption of data at rest, which means that the data is encrypted on the client-side before sending it to the AWS S3 server. The KMS-managed customer master key ensures that only authorized users have access to the data. Therefore, this option is the best solution for securing the PII of patients in an Amazon S3 bucket while complying with compliance and regulatory requirements.
