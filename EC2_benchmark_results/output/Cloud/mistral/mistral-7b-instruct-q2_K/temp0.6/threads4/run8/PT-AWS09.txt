A cryptocurrency trading platform is using an API built in AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Due to the recent news and rumors about the upcoming price surge of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, it is expected that the trading platform would have a significant increase in site visitors and new users in the coming days ahead.

In this scenario, how can you protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes?

(A) Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling.
(B) Enable throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway.
(C) Use CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache.
(D) Move the Lambda function in a VPC.

Answer: 
All of the options (A), (B), (C), and (D) can be used to protect the backend systems of the platform from traffic spikes. However, option (A) is the most recommended solution as it offers better scalability, availability, and control over the infrastructure. It also provides more flexibility and customization options for the application. Option (B) can help in managing the API Gateway's response rate by setting limits on the number of requests that can be made per unit time. Option (C) can provide an extra layer of security and caching, while option (D) can improve the performance of the VPC instances.
