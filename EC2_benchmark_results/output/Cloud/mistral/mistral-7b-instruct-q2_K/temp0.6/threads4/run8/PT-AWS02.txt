The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 
The MOST suitable solution in this scenario would be (C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes. 

Explanation:
AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager is a fully managed service that automates patching, making it easy to update and maintain software on your Amazon EC2 instances. This solution can help you stay compliant by ensuring that all instances are running the latest security patches. It also makes it easier for IT teams to manage large numbers of patches across multiple instances. 

Additionally, AWS Config is a fully managed service that helps you record, monitor, and analyze changes to your AWS resources over time. By using AWS Config in conjunction with AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, you can gain visibility into the configuration of your EC2 instances before and after patches are applied. This will allow you to identify any potential issues that may arise as a result of the patches and quickly address them. 

Option (A) is not the best solution because it does not provide the level of detail required for compliance purposes. Option (B) is also not the best option as it lacks the ability to track configuration changes in Amazon ES. Finally, option (D) is not a suitable option as it would require manual intervention to install patches on a weekly basis, which is not efficient or scalable.
