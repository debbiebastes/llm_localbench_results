The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

The MOST suitable solution in this scenario is (A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:

Option A is the most suitable solution because it directly addresses the security concern by deploying the necessary patches to fix the vulnerabilities on the outdated EC2 instances. It also incorporates monitoring and recording capabilities, which are crucial for audit purposes. 

By using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager to deploy patches, you can easily manage patches across multiple instances with minimal disruption to your operations. Furthermore, integrating Amazon QuickSight with Kibana allows you to track any configuration changes made during the patching process and record them for compliance purposes.

Option B is also a suitable solution, but it does not offer as many benefits as option A. It focuses on patch management only and lacks the monitoring and recording capabilities. 

Options C and D are not suitable solutions because they do not address the security risk or provide the necessary audit and compliance features. Option C focuses solely on deployment of patches without any monitoring or recording, while option D lacks the ability to fix vulnerabilities in real-time.
