A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the hospital has strict compliance and regulatory requirements that require them to never send any sensitive data to AWS. To comply with these requirements, they should implement Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key. This technique allows the hospital to encrypt their data on-premises before sending it to the cloud, ensuring that the data remains secure and compliant throughout its lifecycle. The client-side master key is never sent to AWS and is managed entirely by the hospital, giving them full control over the encryption process and ensuring that their sensitive PII remains protected.
