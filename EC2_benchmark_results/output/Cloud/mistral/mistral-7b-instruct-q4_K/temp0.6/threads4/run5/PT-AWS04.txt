Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(C) 3

Here's why:

When scaling up the number of shards in your Kinesis data stream, you need to consider how many instances are required to process those shards. Since each instance runs one KCL worker and handles one shard, the maximum number of EC2 instances required to achieve optimum performance is equal to the total number of open shards in the stream. In this case, that means launching three instances (since you have six shards).

Therefore, launching five instances would result in unnecessary capacity and potentially wasted resources. Launching twelve instances would also be overkill, as each instance handles only one shard.
