A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The most cost-effective option would be (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. 
This is because the convertible reserved instance allows you to switch between instance types at any time during the reservation period, which means that you can easily adjust your resources as per your needs. Additionally, since the application will be used for more than 3 years, this option offers significant cost savings over the other options as it allows you to pay only for the actual usage of your instance during the reservation period.
