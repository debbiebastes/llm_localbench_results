A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 
The Security Engineer should implement Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. This technique provides end-to-end encryption from the client to the S3 bucket, ensuring that data is encrypted before it leaves the client and remains encrypted while at rest in the S3 bucket. This method also enables the use of a KMS-managed customer master key for encryption and decryption, which ensures compliance with regulatory requirements for managing PII.

Option (A) would not comply with regulatory requirements, as the client-side master key could be intercepted or compromised by an attacker, leaving PII vulnerable. Option (D) is not recommended, as it requires the customer to manage their own keys and may not provide the same level of security and compliance as using a KMS-managed key.
