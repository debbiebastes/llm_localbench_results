AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager is a service that allows you to easily manage software patches and updates on your Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon ECS containers, and Amazon EKS clusters. It automates the process of patching, ensuring that all instances are up-to-date with the latest security patches. This is particularly useful for organizations that have a large number of instances, as it reduces the manual effort required to patch each instance individually.

In addition, AWS Config allows you to record and track any changes made to your EC2 instances, including patches and associated compliance statuses. This information can be used for auditing purposes, ensuring that your organization remains compliant with industry standards and regulations.
