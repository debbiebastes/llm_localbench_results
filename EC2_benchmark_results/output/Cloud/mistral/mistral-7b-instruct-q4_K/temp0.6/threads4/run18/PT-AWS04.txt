Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
(B) 12 

To calculate the maximum number of EC2 instances, you need to multiply the number of shards by the number of KCL worker instances. 

Since you have four shards and each instance has one KCL worker, that means you can achieve optimal performance with four instances. However, if you reshard your stream to six shards, then you would need at least 6 instances to achieve optimum performance. This is because there are more shards to process, so more instances are needed to ensure each shard is processed efficiently.
