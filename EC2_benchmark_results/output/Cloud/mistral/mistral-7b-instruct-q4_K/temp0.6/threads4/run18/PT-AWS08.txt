An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

The correct answer is (A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier. 

Instance store volumes are persistent block storage volumes that provide fast, low-latency access to the root volume of an EC2 instance. Therefore, attaching an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance would be the best option for mission-critical workloads. Additionally, Amazon S3 provides a highly durable and scalable object storage solution, making it ideal for storing backup data. Configuring a lifecycle policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days ensures that infrequently accessed data is stored in a more cost-effective storage class.
