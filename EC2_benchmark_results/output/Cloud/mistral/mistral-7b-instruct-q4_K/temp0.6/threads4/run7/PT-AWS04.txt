Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 
B) 12

The answer is B. If your Kinesis data stream has six shards, and each instance has one KCL worker, then you should launch 12 EC2 instances to achieve optimum performance. This is because the number of EC2 instances that can be launched corresponds to twice the number of shards in your data stream, plus one additional instance for the KCL master.
