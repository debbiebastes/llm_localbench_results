A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
C. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

The reason for this is that EventBridge is a managed event bus service that makes it easy to set up event subscriptions across AWS services, including DynamoDB. With EventBridge, you can create rules that automatically respond to events from multiple sources and route them to your Lambda functions. This way, as new changes are made to the items in DynamoDB, a Lambda function will be triggered to process and save these new changes to the other table. Additionally, setting up EventBridge rule targets is a cost-effective solution as it only requires you to pay for the amount of data processed by your Lambda function.
