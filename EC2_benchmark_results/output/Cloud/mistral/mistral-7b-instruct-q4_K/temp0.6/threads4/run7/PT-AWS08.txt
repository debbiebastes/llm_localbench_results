An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 

C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation: 
Option C is the best solution to meet the above requirement as it provides a persistent block storage volume that can be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service, which is Amazon S3. And after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service, which is Amazon S3 Glacier. This option provides high durability and reliability for mission-critical workloads and ensures that backup data is securely stored for long periods of time. Option A and B do not provide persistent block storage volumes, and option D does not provide a lifecycle policy for transitioning objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
