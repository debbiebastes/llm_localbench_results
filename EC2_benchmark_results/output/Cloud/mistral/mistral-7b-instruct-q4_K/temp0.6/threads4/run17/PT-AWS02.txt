The IT Security team recently discovered a vulnerability in the old operating systems of several EC2 instances. The team needs to immediately mitigate the security risk to safeguard the companyâ€™s applications from various cyber security attacks. For audit purposes, there is also a need to record all of the changes to patch and associated compliance statuses.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution in this scenario?

(A) Deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager. Integrate Amazon QuickSight with Kibana to record and track any configuration changes.
(B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.
(C) Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to easily deploy the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances. Set up AWS Config to record and track any configuration changes.
(D) Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to automatically install the OS patches on a weekly basis.

Answer: 

Option (B) Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to deploy the patches for the EC2 instances with old operating systems. Use Amazon ES to record and track any configuration changes.

Explanation:

AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager is a fully managed service that automates the patching of on-premises, hybrid, and cloud workloads. This service is specifically designed to help IT teams manage and deploy patches across their entire infrastructure, including EC2 instances, at scale.

In this scenario, setting up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager would be the most suitable solution as it will automate the process of deploying the OS patches for the outdated EC2 instances, reducing the risk of human error and ensuring that all instances are patched in a timely manner. Additionally, by using Amazon Elasticsearch Service (ES) to record and track any configuration changes, the IT team can ensure compliance with audit requirements while also maintaining a detailed record of all changes made to the infrastructure.

Option (A) may not be suitable as it requires manual integration with other AWS services such as QuickSight and Kibana, which could introduce additional complexity and potential human error into the process. Option (C) is similar to option (A), but it does not specify which service to use for recording configuration changes. Finally, option (D) may be suitable in certain situations, but it does not address the need for automated patching or compliance recording, which are critical components of this scenario.
