A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 

Option B (No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term) would be the most cost-effective option for an application being hosted that will be used for more than 3 years. This is because it offers the lowest upfront cost, allowing the company to save money on the initial setup and deployment of their application. Additionally, the 3-year term provides a long-term commitment to using Reserved EC2 instances, which can result in significant cost savings compared to On-Demand instances over time.
