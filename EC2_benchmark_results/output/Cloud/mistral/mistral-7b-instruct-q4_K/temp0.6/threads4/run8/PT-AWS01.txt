A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.

The correct answer is (A). This technique is compliant with HIPAA regulations as it requires the client to encrypt the data before sending it to S3, and AWS does not have access to the unencrypted data. Additionally, it also provides end-to-end encryption for the PII data stored in S3. The master key used by the client is kept secret and never sent to AWS.
