Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

To achieve optimum performance, you would need to launch at least one KCL worker per open shard. Therefore, the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch is equal to the number of open shards, which in this case is 6. Hence, you would need to launch 6 KCL workers to achieve optimum performance. Answer: (D) 6
