A developer configured an Amazon API Gateway proxy integration named MyAPI to work with a Lambda function. However, when the API is being called, the developer receives a 502 Bad Gateway error. She tried invoking the underlying function, but it properly returned the result in XML format.

What is the MOST likely root cause of this issue?

(A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend.
(B) The endpoint request timed-out.
(C) There has been an occasional out-of-order invocation due to heavy loads.
(D) The API name of the Amazon API Gateway proxy is invalid.

Answer: 

The MOST likely root cause of this issue is (A) There is an incompatible output returned from a Lambda proxy integration backend. This error occurs when the output format of the Lambda function does not match with the expected format by the Amazon API Gateway. In such cases, the developer needs to modify the Lambda function's code to return the expected output in XML format or update the configuration of the API Gateway to accept a different output format.
