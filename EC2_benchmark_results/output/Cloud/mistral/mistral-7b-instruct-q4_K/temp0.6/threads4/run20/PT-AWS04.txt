Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

Since each instance runs one KCL worker, and there are six shards, the maximum number of instances that you should launch is six. Each instance will have one KCL worker to process data from one shard, so launching more than six instances would not improve performance.
