Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

You have four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. Therefore, the total number of EC2 instances that you are currently running is 4.

When you reshard your stream to six shards, there will be a total of 6 open shards in your data stream. Each instance should have one KCL worker assigned to it, which means that you would need at least 6 instances to cover all the open shards.

Additionally, since each instance has one KCL worker, it is unlikely that adding more instances beyond six will significantly improve performance. Therefore, the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance is 6.
