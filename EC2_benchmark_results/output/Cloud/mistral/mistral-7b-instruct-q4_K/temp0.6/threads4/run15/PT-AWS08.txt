An organization needs a persistent block storage volume that will be used for mission-critical workloads. The backup data will be stored in an object storage service and after 30 days, the data will be stored in a data archiving storage service.

What should you do to meet the above requirement?

(A) Attach an instance store volume in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.
(C) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA.
(D) Attach an instance store volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA

Answer: 
The solution that meets the requirement is (B) Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier.

Explanation:
A block storage device such as an EBS volume provides persistent storage for your EC2 instance, which makes it suitable for mission-critical workloads. Also, using Amazon S3 for backup data storage allows you to store and manage large amounts of data securely and cost-effectively. By configuring a lifecycle policy that transitions objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 30 days, you ensure that your backup data is stored in a low-cost storage class that is designed for infrequent access. This solution provides the required persistence, scalability, and cost-effectiveness for mission-critical workloads while also meeting the backup and archiving requirements.
