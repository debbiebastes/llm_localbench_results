A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
Option (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term would be the most cost-effective option. This option allows you to pay nothing up front and you will receive a discount of up to 60% off of On-Demand prices over a three year period. In this case, the application being hosted would be used for more than three years, so the Convertible Reserved Instance pricing option would offer significant cost savings compared to the other options.
