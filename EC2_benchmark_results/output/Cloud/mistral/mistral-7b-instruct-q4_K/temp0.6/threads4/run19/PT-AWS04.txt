Your application is processing one Kinesis data stream which has four shards, and each instance has one KCL worker. To scale up processing in your application, you reshard your stream to increase the number of open shards to six.

What is the MAXIMUM number of EC2 instances that you should launch to achieve optimum performance?

(A) 5
(B) 12
(C) 3
(D) 6

Answer: 

(B) 12 

To achieve the best performance with a Kinesis data stream, you should launch one EC2 instance per shard. So, for six shards, you would launch six instances. However, to ensure high availability and fault tolerance, it's recommended to launch two EC2 instances per shard, which gives you a total of 12 EC2 instances. This will provide redundancy and help ensure that your application can handle any potential failures or issues with the KCL worker processes.
