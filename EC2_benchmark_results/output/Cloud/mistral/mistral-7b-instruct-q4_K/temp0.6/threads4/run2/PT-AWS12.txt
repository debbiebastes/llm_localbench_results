A company is currently using an On-Demand EC2 instance for their application which they plan to migrate to a Reserved EC2 Instance to save on cost. Which of the following is the most cost-effective option if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years?	

(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The most cost-effective option would be (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term. This is because the convertible reserved instance allows you to switch between an on-demand instance and a reserved instance at any time during the term without incurring any additional fees. Therefore, if the application being hosted would be used for more than 3 years, it would be more cost-effective to use a convertible reserved instance rather than a standard reserved instance or an on-demand instance.
