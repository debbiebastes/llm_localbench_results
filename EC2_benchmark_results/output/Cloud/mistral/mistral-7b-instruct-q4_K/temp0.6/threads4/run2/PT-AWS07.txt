A tech company has a CRM application hosted on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances with different instance types and sizes. The application is extensively used during office hours from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. Their users are complaining that the performance of the application is slow during the start of the day but then works normally after a couple of hours.

Which of the following is the MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day?

(A) Configure a Predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances
(B) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
(C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
(D) Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

Answer: 

The MOST operationally efficient solution to implement to ensure the application works properly at the beginning of the day would be (C) Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day. This is because the performance issue could be due to the application not having enough resources at the beginning of the day when there are fewer users. By adding more instances ahead of time, the application will have the necessary resources to handle the increased traffic during office hours.

Additionally, it may also be useful to analyze the performance of the existing instances during the start of the day and adjust the instance type and size accordingly to further optimize the resource utilization and cost efficiency.
