A leading hospital has a web application hosted in AWS that will store sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its patients in an Amazon S3 bucket. Both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS to comply with the strict compliance and regulatory requirements of the company. 

Which S3 encryption technique should the Security Engineer implement?

(A) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key.
(B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key. 
(C) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key.
(D) Implement an Amazon S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key.

Answer: 

The correct answer is (B) Implement an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key.

Explanation:

By implementing an Amazon S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key, the Security Engineer ensures that all data encrypted before it's uploaded to S3 is encrypted using an AWS managed key, while the master key itself is never sent to AWS. This approach also allows for easy management of keys and key rotations.

Option (A) involves sending the client-side master key to AWS, which doesn't meet compliance requirements. Option (C) sends the server-side encryption key to AWS, which is also not compliant. Option (D) allows for customer-managed encryption keys but may lead to potential mismanagement of keys and key rotations, making it less secure than using a KMS-managed key.
