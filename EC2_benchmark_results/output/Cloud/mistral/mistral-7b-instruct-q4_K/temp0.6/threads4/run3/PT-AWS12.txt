(A) All Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term.
(B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(C) All Upfront, Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.
(D) No Upfront Standard Reserved Instance pricing for a 1-year term that is renewed every year.

Answer: 
The most cost-effective option would be (B) No Upfront Convertible Reserved Instance pricing for a 3-year term.

Explanation: 
Option B offers the best value for money if the application will be used for more than 3 years as it allows for no upfront costs and a lower monthly charge compared to the other options. Additionally, the convertibility of the instance ensures that it can be easily converted into a different instance type if needed in the future.
