A serverless application composed of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB has been running without issues for quite some time. As part of the IT compliance of the company, a developer was instructed to ensure that all of the new changes made to the items in DynamoDB are recorded and stored in another DynamoDB table in another region.

In this scenario, which of the following is the MOST ideal way to comply with the requirements?

(A) Set up DynamoDB Accelerator
(B) Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery to automatically sync the two tables.
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.
(D) Enable DynamoDB Streams and configure a Lambda function to process and save new changes to the other table.

Answer: 
(C) Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that tracks table-level events in DynamoDB. Set a Lambda function as a rule target to process and save new changes to the other table.

Explanation: The most ideal way to comply with the requirements would be to use AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and Amazon DynamoDB. By creating an EventBridge rule that tracks table-level events in one of the tables, you can set up a Lambda function as the target to process and save new changes to the other table. This way, every time a change is made to the items in the first table, it will be automatically recorded and stored in the second table. By using this solution, you can ensure that all of your changes are properly recorded and stored in another region for compliance purposes.
