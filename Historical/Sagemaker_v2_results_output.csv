You've probably heard ""landing zones"" mentioned at some point or another if you work even just tangentially in the Cloud industry. It sounds very important, and even sort-of, kind-of military-ish. So what the heck exactly is a landing zone in the Cloud, and why should you care?
What does ""landing zone"" even mean?
In the military, a landing zone (LZ) is literally a pad or area where aircraft (especially helicopters) can land. If there is an LZ in an area, then you know that everyone being airlifted to the area will land and start at the exact same place - the LZ. It doesn't matter if we're airlifting new personnel, medical supplies, or arms and ammunition. They all land and start their life in that new area on the LZ, where we know it is secure and necessary support operations are in place.
The Cloud co-opted that terminology because it describes what we want to accomplish when it comes to scaling Cloud adoption and governance. We want every single Cloud account, across all the business units (BUs) of an organization, to start at the exact same, predefined starting point.
We want to make sure every new account follows the same baseline security guidelines and best practices, and have access to the same basic building blocks as everybody else.
How does a landing zone help me?
At their core, Cloud landing zones are a scalable and secure configuration to make complex Cloud environments (read: Enterprise-level, multi-account environments) easier to govern and, just as critically, easier to adopt.
Landing zones are meant to help two distinct general Cloud stakeholders, which we can loosely identify as ""admins"" and ""consumers"":
Admins: For those that are ultimately responsible for the administration of Cloud accounts, a landing zone approach makes it easier for them to centrally manage and govern the entirety of their multi-account environment.
Consumers: These are the general Cloud users in an organization. They might be developers who create applications in the Cloud, or they might simply be users who need to deploy specific infrastructure (VMs, storage, databases…).
Typically, consumers are interested only in consuming Cloud services. This is a problem, because that means they usually don't care about (and are also typically not trained for) security and compliance in the Cloud. So if important aspects of Cloud usage (like security, cost and various other policy compliance) are left to the goodwill of consumers, well… that multi-account environment you have is headed for a really bad nightmare.
And this is why landing zones are essential.
An LZ helps the Cloud admins by giving them centralized management of their multi-account environment, with baselines and automations baked-in. Security and service controls for each new account created, for example, means Cloud admins will have the peace of mind knowing that consumers in every account are automatically following these security and service controls, because their creation and enforcement are automatic.
An LZ helps the Cloud consumers, too, because now they can focus on their work, instead of (for example) figuring out how to implement an encrypted, centralized Cloud audit trail so that IT Audit won't yell at them next year. They know the landing zone is already set up so that all necessary security and governance baselines are in place - with no effort on their end.
It's a win-win.

AWS Lambda (and serverless and Functions-as-a-Service (Faas), in general) is the best way to run code. Most of the operational overhead is not your responsibility (i.e., no servers to administer). What's not super obvious, though, is how to scale performance in Lambda using multithreading.
In this new serverless series, we'll dive into multithreading in AWS Lambda, looking at implementation, scaling, and even comparing multithreading vs multi-instance architectures.
Today, in part 1, I'll provide experimental data to show how multithreaded performance scales in Lambda.
TL;DR: What memory size for X number of threads?
Above is the table of summarized results from this experiment, showing at what point a Lambda function will have max performance for a certain number of threads (workers):
- One thread = 2048MB
- Two threads = 4096MB
- Three threads = 5376MB
- Four threads = 7168MB
- Five threads = 8960MB
- Six threads = 10240MB (Lambda max memory size)
Now, if you're wondering how to interpret this and how we got the data in that table, read on!
Quick refresher: AWS Lambda and core counts
While you don't have to worry about servers in Lambda, you do still have to worry about some important things (but only very lightly, far from having to actually worry about a real server). Available compute resources - in the form of compute cores and memory - is one of these things.
In AWS Lambda, while you can directly specify the amount of RAM your function will have (currently from 128MB all the way to 10240MB, in 1MB increments), you can't do the same for CPU cores.
Instead, as you increase memory, you also get a proportional amount of CPU power. IIRC, back when Lambda only had a 4GB RAM limit, there used to be an official graph in the documentation that showed you when you get an additional core. I can't find it anymore. (Maybe my Google-fu is failing; if you still know where this is, please link in the comments!)
So, here in Part 1, what we'll uncover is exactly that problem - let's figure out at what points in RAM amounts our Lambda function gets to enjoy the power of additional cores. For this, we will need a CPU-intensive load, give it varying amounts of RAM from 128MB up to 10GB, and also vary the number of workers each time (i.e., how multi-threaded it is) from 1 to 6 (6 is the current maximum number of cores you will get in a Lambda function)
The experiment: CPU-intensive load through password hashing...

Summarize the excerpt above into key points using 10 sentences or less.

Key-points:
","* AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows users to run code without worrying about servers.
* In Lambda, users can specify the amount of RAM their function will have, but not the number of CPU cores.
* As the amount of RAM increases, the number of CPU cores also increases proportionally.
* The author of the article is trying to figure out at what points in RAM amounts a Lambda function gets to enjoy the power of additional cores.
* The author uses a CPU-intensive load, password hashing, to test the performance of Lambda functions with varying amounts of RAM and number of workers.
* The author tests the performance of Lambda functions with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 workers.
* The author finds that the performance of the Lambda function improves as the number of workers increases, but eventually plateaus.
* The author creates a table summarizing the results of the experiment, showing the optimal memory size for each number of workers.
* According to the table, one worker performs best with 2048MB of memory, two workers perform best with 4096MB, and so on.
* The author notes that the results of the experiment are not definitive and may vary depending on the specific use case."

An LZ helps the Cloud consumers, too, because now they can focus on their work, instead of (for example) figuring out how to implement an encrypted, centralized Cloud audit trail so that IT Audit won't yell at them next year. They know the landing zone is already set up so that all necessary security and governance baselines are in place - with no effort on their end.

AWS Lambda (and serverless and Functions-as-a-Service (Faas), in general) is the best way to run code. Most of the operational overhead is not your responsibility (i.e., no servers to administer). What's not super obvious, though, is how to scale performance in Lambda using multithreading.
In this new serverless series, we'll dive into multithreading in AWS Lambda, looking at implementation, scaling, and even comparing multithreading vs multi-instance architectures.
Today, in part 1, I'll provide experimental data to show how multithreaded performance scales in Lambda.
TL;DR: What memory size for X number of threads?
Above is the table of summarized results from this experiment, showing at what point a Lambda function will have max performance for a certain number of threads (workers):
- One thread = 2048MB
- Two threads = 4096MB
- Three threads = 5376MB
- Four threads = 7168MB
- Five threads = 8960MB
- Six threads = 10240MB (Lambda max memory size)
Now, if you're wondering how to interpret this and how we got the data in that table, read on!
Quick refresher: AWS Lambda and core counts
While you don't have to worry about servers in Lambda, you do still have to worry about some important things (but only very lightly, far from having to actually worry about a real server). Available compute resources - in the form of compute cores and memory - is one of these things.
In AWS Lambda, while you can directly specify the amount of RAM your function will have (currently from 128MB all the way to 10240MB, in 1MB increments), you can't do the same for CPU cores.
Instead, as you increase memory, you also get a proportional amount of CPU power. IIRC, back when Lambda only had a 4GB RAM limit, there used to be an official graph in the documentation that showed you when you get an additional core. I can't find it anymore. (Maybe my Google-fu is failing; if you still know where this is, please link in the comments!)
So, here in Part 1, what we'll uncover is exactly that problem - let's figure out at what points in RAM amounts our Lambda function gets to enjoy the power of additional cores. For this, we will need a CPU-intensive load, give it varying amounts of RAM from 128MB up to 10GB, and also vary the number of workers each time (i.e., how multi-threaded it is) from 1 to 6 (6 is the current maximum number of cores you will get in a Lambda function)
The experiment: CPU-intensive load through password hashing...

Summarize the excerpt above into key points using 10 sentences or less.

Key-points:
","* AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows users to run code without worrying about servers.
* In Lambda, users can specify the amount of RAM their function will have, but not the number of CPU cores.
* As the amount of RAM increases, the function also gets a proportional amount of CPU power.

You've probably heard ""landing zones"" mentioned at some point or another if you work even just tangentially in the Cloud industry. It sounds very important, and even sort-of, kind-of military-ish. So what the heck exactly is a landing zone in the Cloud, and why should you care?
What does ""landing zone"" even mean?
In the military, a landing zone (LZ) is literally a pad or area where aircraft (especially helicopters) can land. If there is an LZ in an area, then you know that everyone being airlifted to the area will land and start at the exact same place - the LZ. It doesn't matter if we're airlifting new personnel, medical supplies, or arms and ammunition. They all land and start their life in that new area on the LZ, where we know it is secure and necessary support operations are in place.
The Cloud co-opted that terminology because it describes what we want to accomplish when it comes to scaling Cloud adoption and governance. We want every single Cloud account, across all the business units (BUs) of an organization, to start at the exact same, predefined starting point.
We want to make sure every new account follows the same baseline security guidelines and best practices, and have access to the same basic building blocks as everybody else.
How does a landing zone help me?
At their core, Cloud landing zones are a scalable and secure configuration to make complex Cloud environments (read: Enterprise-level, multi-account environments) easier to govern and, just as critically, easier to adopt.
Landing zones are meant to help two distinct general Cloud stakeholders, which we can loosely identify as ""admins"" and ""consumers"":
Admins: For those that are ultimately responsible for the administration of Cloud accounts, a landing zone approach makes it easier for them to centrally manage and govern the entirety of their multi-account environment.
Consumers: These are the general Cloud users in an organization. They might be developers who create applications in the Cloud, or they might simply be users who need to deploy specific infrastructure (VMs, storage, databases…).
Typically, consumers are interested only in consuming Cloud services. This is a problem, because that means they usually don't care about (and are also typically not trained for) security and compliance in the Cloud. So if important aspects of Cloud usage (like security, cost and various other policy compliance) are left to the goodwill of consumers, well… that multi-account environment you have is headed for a really bad nightmare.
And this is why landing zones are essential.
An LZ helps the Cloud admins by giving them centralized management of their multi-account environment, with baselines and automations baked-in. Security and service controls for each new account created, for example, means Cloud admins will have the peace of mind knowing that consumers in every account are automatically following these security and service controls, because their creation and enforcement are automatic.
An LZ helps the Cloud consumers, too, because now they can focus on their work, instead of (for example) figuring out how to implement an encrypted, centralized Cloud audit trail so that IT Audit won't yell at them next year. They know the landing zone is already set up so that all necessary security and governance baselines are in place - with no effort on their end.

You've probably heard ""landing zones"" mentioned at some point or another if you work even just tangentially in the Cloud industry. It sounds very important, and even sort-of, kind-of military-ish. So what the heck exactly is a landing zone in the Cloud, and why should you care?
What does ""landing zone"" even mean?
In the military, a landing zone (LZ) is literally a pad or area where aircraft (especially helicopters) can land. If there is an LZ in an area, then you know that everyone being airlifted to the area will land and start at the exact same place - the LZ. It doesn't matter if we're airlifting new personnel, medical supplies, or arms and ammunition. They all land and start their life in that new area on the LZ, where we know it is secure and necessary support operations are in place.
The Cloud co-opted that terminology because it describes what we want to accomplish when it comes to scaling Cloud adoption and governance. We want every single Cloud account, across all the business units (BUs) of an organization, to start at the exact same, predefined starting point.
We want to make sure every new account follows the same baseline security guidelines and best practices, and have access to the same basic building blocks as everybody else.
How does a landing zone help me?
At their core, Cloud landing zones are a scalable and secure configuration to make complex Cloud environments (read: Enterprise-level, multi-account environments) easier to govern and, just as critically, easier to adopt.
Landing zones are meant to help two distinct general Cloud stakeholders, which we can loosely identify as ""admins"" and ""consumers"":
Admins: For those that are ultimately responsible for the administration of Cloud accounts, a landing zone approach makes it easier for them to centrally manage and govern the entirety of their multi-account environment.
Consumers: These are the general Cloud users in an organization. They might be developers who create applications in the Cloud, or they might simply be users who need to deploy specific infrastructure (VMs, storage, databases…).
Typically, consumers are interested only in consuming Cloud services. This is a problem, because that means they usually don't care about (and are also typically not trained for) security and compliance in the Cloud. So if important aspects of Cloud usage (like security, cost and various other policy compliance) are left to the goodwill of consumers, well… that multi-account environment you have is headed for a really bad nightmare.
And this is why landing zones are essential.
An LZ helps the Cloud admins by giving them centralized management of their multi-account environment, with baselines and automations baked-in. Security and service controls for each new account created, for example, means Cloud admins will have the peace of mind knowing that consumers in every account are automatically following these security and service controls, because their creation and enforcement are automatic.
An LZ helps the Cloud consumers, too, because now they can focus on their work, instead of (for example) figuring out how to implement an encrypted, centralized Cloud audit trail so that IT Audit won't yell at them next year. They know the landing zone is already set up so that all necessary security and governance baselines are in place - with no effort on their end.
It's a win-win.

AWS Lambda (and serverless and Functions-as-a-Service (Faas), in general) is the best way to run code. Most of the operational overhead is not your responsibility (i.e., no servers to administer). What's not super obvious, though, is how to scale performance in Lambda using multithreading.
In this new serverless series, we'll dive into multithreading in AWS Lambda, looking at implementation, scaling, and even comparing multithreading vs multi-instance architectures.
Today, in part 1, I'll provide experimental data to show how multithreaded performance scales in Lambda.
TL;DR: What memory size for X number of threads?
Above is the table of summarized results from this experiment, showing at what point a Lambda function will have max performance for a certain number of threads (workers):
- One thread = 2048MB
- Two threads = 4096MB
- Three threads = 5376MB
- Four threads = 7168MB
- Five threads = 8960MB
- Six threads = 10240MB (Lambda max memory size)
Now, if you're wondering how to interpret this and how we got the data in that table, read on!
Quick refresher: AWS Lambda and core counts
While you don't have to worry about servers in Lambda, you do still have to worry about some important things (but only very lightly, far from having to actually worry about a real server). Available compute resources - in the form of compute cores and memory - is one of these things.
In AWS Lambda, while you can directly specify the amount of RAM your function will have (currently from 128MB all the way to 10240MB, in 1MB increments), you can't do the same for CPU cores.
Instead, as you increase memory, you also get a proportional amount of CPU power. IIRC, back when Lambda only had a 4GB RAM limit, there used to be an official graph in the documentation that showed you when you get an additional core. I can't find it anymore. (Maybe my Google-fu is failing; if you still know where this is, please link in the comments!)
So, here in Part 1, what we'll uncover is exactly that problem - let's figure out at what points in RAM amounts our Lambda function gets to enjoy the power of additional cores. For this, we will need a CPU-intensive load, give it varying amounts of RAM from 128MB up to 10GB, and also vary the number of workers each time (i.e., how multi-threaded it is) from 1 to 6 (6 is the current maximum number of cores you will get in a Lambda function)
The experiment: CPU-intensive load through password hashing...

Summarize the excerpt above into key points using 10 sentences or less.

Key-points:
","* AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows users to run code without worrying about servers.
* In Lambda, users can specify the amount of RAM their function will have, but not the number of CPU cores.
* As the amount of RAM increases, the number of CPU cores also increases proportionally.
* The author of the article is trying to figure out at what points in RAM amounts a Lambda function gets additional cores.
* The author is using a CPU-intensive load, password hashing, to test the performance of Lambda functions with varying amounts of RAM and number of workers.
* The author is testing with 1 to 6 workers (threads) to see how multithreading affects performance.
* The author has created a table showing the maximum performance for each number of workers, with the corresponding amount of RAM required for that performance.
* The table shows that one worker performs best with 2048MB of RAM, two workers perform best with 4096MB, and so on, up to six workers, which require 10240MB of RAM for maximum performance.
* The author notes that this information can be useful for optimizing Lambda function performance."

AWS Lambda (and serverless and Functions-as-a-Service (Faas), in general) is the best way to run code. Most of the operational overhead is not your responsibility (i.e., no servers to administer). What's not super obvious, though, is how to scale performance in Lambda using multithreading.
In this new serverless series, we'll dive into multithreading in AWS Lambda, looking at implementation, scaling, and even comparing multithreading vs multi-instance architectures.
Today, in part 1, I'll provide experimental data to show how multithreaded performance scales in Lambda.
TL;DR: What memory size for X number of threads?
Above is the table of summarized results from this experiment, showing at what point a Lambda function will have max performance for a certain number of threads (workers):
- One thread = 2048MB
- Two threads = 4096MB
- Three threads = 5376MB
- Four threads = 7168MB
- Five threads = 8960MB
- Six threads = 10240MB (Lambda max memory size)
Now, if you're wondering how to interpret this and how we got the data in that table, read on!
Quick refresher: AWS Lambda and core counts
While you don't have to worry about servers in Lambda, you do still have to worry about some important things (but only very lightly, far from having to actually worry about a real server). Available compute resources - in the form of compute cores and memory - is one of these things.
In AWS Lambda, while you can directly specify the amount of RAM your function will have (currently from 128MB all the way to 10240MB, in 1MB increments), you can't do the same for CPU cores.
Instead, as you increase memory, you also get a proportional amount of CPU power. IIRC, back when Lambda only had a 4GB RAM limit, there used to be an official graph in the documentation that showed you when you get an additional core. I can't find it anymore. (Maybe my Google-fu is failing; if you still know where this is, please link in the comments!)
So, here in Part 1, what we'll uncover is exactly that problem - let's figure out at what points in RAM amounts our Lambda function gets to enjoy the power of additional cores. For this, we will need a CPU-intensive load, give it varying amounts of RAM from 128MB up to 10GB, and also vary the number of workers each time (i.e., how multi-threaded it is) from 1 to 6 (6 is the current maximum number of cores you will get in a Lambda function)
The experiment: CPU-intensive load through password hashing...

You've probably heard ""landing zones"" mentioned at some point or another if you work even just tangentially in the Cloud industry. It sounds very important, and even sort-of, kind-of military-ish. So what the heck exactly is a landing zone in the Cloud, and why should you care?
What does ""landing zone"" even mean?
In the military, a landing zone (LZ) is literally a pad or area where aircraft (especially helicopters) can land. If there is an LZ in an area, then you know that everyone being airlifted to the area will land and start at the exact same place - the LZ. It doesn't matter if we're airlifting new personnel, medical supplies, or arms and ammunition. They all land and start their life in that new area on the LZ, where we know it is secure and necessary support operations are in place.
The Cloud co-opted that terminology because it describes what we want to accomplish when it comes to scaling Cloud adoption and governance. We want every single Cloud account, across all the business units (BUs) of an organization, to start at the exact same, predefined starting point.
We want to make sure every new account follows the same baseline security guidelines and best practices, and have access to the same basic building blocks as everybody else.
How does a landing zone help me?
At their core, Cloud landing zones are a scalable and secure configuration to make complex Cloud environments (read: Enterprise-level, multi-account environments) easier to govern and, just as critically, easier to adopt.
Landing zones are meant to help two distinct general Cloud stakeholders, which we can loosely identify as ""admins"" and ""consumers"":
Admins: For those that are ultimately responsible for the administration of Cloud accounts, a landing zone approach makes it easier for them to centrally manage and govern the entirety of their multi-account environment.
Consumers: These are the general Cloud users in an organization. They might be developers who create applications in the Cloud, or they might simply be users who need to deploy specific infrastructure (VMs, storage, databases…).
Typically, consumers are interested only in consuming Cloud services. This is a problem, because that means they usually don't care about (and are also typically not trained for) security and compliance in the Cloud. So if important aspects of Cloud usage (like security, cost and various other policy compliance) are left to the goodwill of consumers, well… that multi-account environment you have is headed for a really bad nightmare.
And this is why landing zones are essential.
An LZ helps the Cloud admins by giving them centralized management of their multi-account environment, with baselines and automations baked-in. Security and service controls for each new account created, for example, means Cloud admins will have the peace of mind knowing that consumers in every account are automatically following these security and service controls, because their creation and enforcement are automatic.
An LZ helps the Cloud consumers, too, because now they can focus on their work, instead of (for example) figuring out how to implement an encrypted, centralized Cloud audit trail so that IT Audit won't yell at them next year. They know the landing zone is already set up so that all necessary security and governance baselines are in place - with no effort on their end.
It's a win-win.

You've probably heard ""landing zones"" mentioned at some point or another if you work even just tangentially in the Cloud industry. It sounds very important, and even sort-of, kind-of military-ish. So what the heck exactly is a landing zone in the Cloud, and why should you care?
What does ""landing zone"" even mean?
In the military, a landing zone (LZ) is literally a pad or area where aircraft (especially helicopters) can land. If there is an LZ in an area, then you know that everyone being airlifted to the area will land and start at the exact same place - the LZ. It doesn't matter if we're airlifting new personnel, medical supplies, or arms and ammunition. They all land and start their life in that new area on the LZ, where we know it is secure and necessary support operations are in place.
The Cloud co-opted that terminology because it describes what we want to accomplish when it comes to scaling Cloud adoption and governance. We want every single Cloud account, across all the business units (BUs) of an organization, to start at the exact same, predefined starting point.
We want to make sure every new account follows the same baseline security guidelines and best practices, and have access to the same basic building blocks as everybody else.
How does a landing zone help me?
At their core, Cloud landing zones are a scalable and secure configuration to make complex Cloud environments (read: Enterprise-level, multi-account environments) easier to govern and, just as critically, easier to adopt.
Landing zones are meant to help two distinct general Cloud stakeholders, which we can loosely identify as ""admins"" and ""consumers"":
Admins: For those that are ultimately responsible for the administration of Cloud accounts, a landing zone approach makes it easier for them to centrally manage and govern the entirety of their multi-account environment.
Consumers: These are the general Cloud users in an organization. They might be developers who create applications in the Cloud, or they might simply be users who need to deploy specific infrastructure (VMs, storage, databases…).
Typically, consumers are interested only in consuming Cloud services. This is a problem, because that means they usually don't care about (and are also typically not trained for) security and compliance in the Cloud. So if important aspects of Cloud usage (like security, cost and various other policy compliance) are left to the goodwill of consumers, well… that multi-account environment you have is headed for a really bad nightmare.
And this is why landing zones are essential.
An LZ helps the Cloud admins by giving them centralized management of their multi-account environment, with baselines and automations baked-in. Security and service controls for each new account created, for example, means Cloud admins will have the peace of mind knowing that consumers in every account are automatically following these security and service controls, because their creation and enforcement are automatic.
An LZ helps the Cloud consumers, too, because now they can focus on their work, instead of (for example) figuring out how to implement an encrypted, centralized Cloud audit trail so that IT Audit won't yell at them next year. They know the landing zone is already set up so that all necessary security and governance baselines are in place - with no effort on their end.
It's a win-win.

AWS Lambda (and serverless and Functions-as-a-Service (Faas), in general) is the best way to run code. Most of the operational overhead is not your responsibility (i.e., no servers to administer). What's not super obvious, though, is how to scale performance in Lambda using multithreading.
In this new serverless series, we'll dive into multithreading in AWS Lambda, looking at implementation, scaling, and even comparing multithreading vs multi-instance architectures.
Today, in part 1, I'll provide experimental data to show how multithreaded performance scales in Lambda.
TL;DR: What memory size for X number of threads?
Above is the table of summarized results from this experiment, showing at what point a Lambda function will have max performance for a certain number of threads (workers):
- One thread = 2048MB
- Two threads = 4096MB
- Three threads = 5376MB
- Four threads = 7168MB
- Five threads = 8960MB
- Six threads = 10240MB (Lambda max memory size)
Now, if you're wondering how to interpret this and how we got the data in that table, read on!
Quick refresher: AWS Lambda and core counts
While you don't have to worry about servers in Lambda, you do still have to worry about some important things (but only very lightly, far from having to actually worry about a real server). Available compute resources - in the form of compute cores and memory - is one of these things.
In AWS Lambda, while you can directly specify the amount of RAM your function will have (currently from 128MB all the way to 10240MB, in 1MB increments), you can't do the same for CPU cores.
Instead, as you increase memory, you also get a proportional amount of CPU power. IIRC, back when Lambda only had a 4GB RAM limit, there used to be an official graph in the documentation that showed you when you get an additional core. I can't find it anymore. (Maybe my Google-fu is failing; if you still know where this is, please link in the comments!)
So, here in Part 1, what we'll uncover is exactly that problem - let's figure out at what points in RAM amounts our Lambda function gets to enjoy the power of additional cores. For this, we will need a CPU-intensive load, give it varying amounts of RAM from 128MB up to 10GB, and also vary the number of workers each time (i.e., how multi-threaded it is) from 1 to 6 (6 is the current maximum number of cores you will get in a Lambda function)
The experiment: CPU-intensive load through password hashing...

Summarize the excerpt above into key points using 10 sentences or less.

Key-points:
","* AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows users to run code without worrying about servers.
* In Lambda, the amount of CPU power and memory available is proportional to the amount of memory specified.
* The author of the article is trying to figure out at what points in RAM amounts a Lambda function gets additional cores.
* The author uses a CPU-intensive load, password hashing, to test the performance of Lambda functions with varying amounts of RAM and number of workers.
* The author tests the performance of Lambda functions with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 workers.
* The author finds that the performance of the Lambda function increases as the number of workers increases.
* The author also finds that the performance of the Lambda function increases as the amount of RAM increases.
* The author creates a table summarizing the results of the experiment, showing the optimal amount of RAM for a given number of workers.
* According to the table, one worker performs best with 2048MB of RAM, two workers perform best with 4096MB of RAM, and so on.
* The author notes that the results of the experiment are not definitive and may vary depending on the specific use case."

- Four threads = 7168MB
- Five threads = 8960MB

Now, if you're wondering how to interpret this and how we got the data in that table, read on!
Quick refresher: AWS Lambda and core counts
While you don't have to worry about servers in Lambda, you do still have to worry about some important things (but only very lightly, far from having to actually worry about a real server). Available compute resources - in the form of compute cores and memory - is one of these things.
In AWS Lambda, while you can directly specify the amount of RAM your function will have (currently from 128MB all the way to 10240MB, in 1MB increments), you can't do the same for CPU cores.
Instead, as you increase memory, you also get a proportional amount of CPU power. IIRC, back when Lambda only had a 4GB RAM limit, there used to be an official graph in the documentation that showed you when you get an additional core. I can't find it anymore. (Maybe my Google-fu is failing; if you still know where this is, please link in the comments!)
So, here in Part 1, what we'll uncover is exactly that problem - let's figure out at what points in RAM amounts our Lambda function gets to enjoy the power of additional cores. For this, we will need a CPU-intensive load, give it varying amounts of RAM from 128MB up to 10GB, and also vary the number of workers each time (i.e., how multi-threaded it is) from 1 to 6 (6 is the current maximum number of cores you will get in a Lambda function)
The experiment: CPU-intensive load through password hashing...

You've probably heard ""landing zones"" mentioned at some point or another if you work even just tangentially in the Cloud industry. It sounds very important, and even sort-of, kind-of military-ish. So what the heck exactly is a landing zone in the Cloud, and why should you care?
What does ""landing zone"" even mean?
In the military, a landing zone (LZ) is literally a pad or area where aircraft (especially helicopters) can land. If there is an LZ in an area, then you know that everyone being airlifted to the area will land and start at the exact same place - the LZ. It doesn't matter if we're airlifting new personnel, medical supplies, or arms and ammunition. They all land and start their life in that new area on the LZ, where we know it is secure and necessary support operations are in place.
The Cloud co-opted that terminology because it describes what we want to accomplish when it comes to scaling Cloud adoption and governance. We want every single Cloud account, across all the business units (BUs) of an organization, to start at the exact same, predefined starting point.
We want to make sure every new account follows the same baseline security guidelines and best practices, and have access to the same basic building blocks as everybody else.
How does a landing zone help me?
At their core, Cloud landing zones are a scalable and secure configuration to make complex Cloud environments (read: Enterprise-level, multi-account environments) easier to govern and, just as critically, easier to adopt.
Landing zones are meant to help two distinct general Cloud stakeholders, which we can loosely identify as ""admins"" and ""consumers"":
Admins: For those that are ultimately responsible for the administration of Cloud accounts, a landing zone approach makes it easier for them to centrally manage and govern the entirety of their multi-account environment.
Consumers: These are the general Cloud users in an organization. They might be developers who create applications in the Cloud, or they might simply be users who need to deploy specific infrastructure (VMs, storage, databases…).
Typically, consumers are interested only in consuming Cloud services. This is a problem, because that means they usually don't care about (and are also typically not trained for) security and compliance in the Cloud. So if important aspects of Cloud usage (like security, cost and various other policy compliance) are left to the goodwill of consumers, well… that multi-account environment you have is headed for a really bad nightmare.
And this is why landing zones are essential.
An LZ helps the Cloud admins by giving them centralized management of their multi-account environment, with baselines and automations baked-in. Security and service controls for each new account created, for example, means Cloud admins will have the peace of mind knowing that consumers in every account are automatically following these security and service controls, because their creation and enforcement are automatic.
An LZ helps the Cloud consumers, too, because now they can focus on their work, instead of (for example) figuring out how to implement an encrypted, centralized Cloud audit trail so that IT Audit won't yell at them next year. They know the landing zone is already set up so that all necessary security and governance baselines are in place - with no effort on their end.
It's a win-win.

AWS Lambda (and serverless and Functions-as-a-Service (Faas), in general) is the best way to run code. Most of the operational overhead is not your responsibility (i.e., no servers to administer). What's not super obvious, though, is how to scale performance in Lambda using multithreading.
In this new serverless series, we'll dive into multithreading in AWS Lambda, looking at implementation, scaling, and even comparing multithreading vs multi-instance architectures.
Today, in part 1, I'll provide experimental data to show how multithreaded performance scales in Lambda.
TL;DR: What memory size for X number of threads?
Above is the table of summarized results from this experiment, showing at what point a Lambda function will have max performance for a certain number of threads (workers):
- One thread = 2048MB
- Two threads = 4096MB
- Three threads = 5376MB
- Four threads = 7168MB
- Five threads = 8960MB
- Six threads = 10240MB (Lambda max memory size)

You've probably heard ""landing zones"" mentioned at some point or another if you work even just tangentially in the Cloud industry. It sounds very important, and even sort-of, kind-of military-ish. So what the heck exactly is a landing zone in the Cloud, and why should you care?
What does ""landing zone"" even mean?
In the military, a landing zone (LZ) is literally a pad or area where aircraft (especially helicopters) can land. If there is an LZ in an area, then you know that everyone being airlifted to the area will land and start at the exact same place - the LZ. It doesn't matter if we're airlifting new personnel, medical supplies, or arms and ammunition. They all land and start their life in that new area on the LZ, where we know it is secure and necessary support operations are in place.
The Cloud co-opted that terminology because it describes what we want to accomplish when it comes to scaling Cloud adoption and governance. We want every single Cloud account, across all the business units (BUs) of an organization, to start at the exact same, predefined starting point.
We want to make sure every new account follows the same baseline security guidelines and best practices, and have access to the same basic building blocks as everybody else.
How does a landing zone help me?
At their core, Cloud landing zones are a scalable and secure configuration to make complex Cloud environments (read: Enterprise-level, multi-account environments) easier to govern and, just as critically, easier to adopt.
Landing zones are meant to help two distinct general Cloud stakeholders, which we can loosely identify as ""admins"" and ""consumers"":
Admins: For those that are ultimately responsible for the administration of Cloud accounts, a landing zone approach makes it easier for them to centrally manage and govern the entirety of their multi-account environment.
Consumers: These are the general Cloud users in an organization. They might be developers who create applications in the Cloud, or they might simply be users who need to deploy specific infrastructure (VMs, storage, databases…).
Typically, consumers are interested only in consuming Cloud services. This is a problem, because that means they usually don't care about (and are also typically not trained for) security and compliance in the Cloud. So if important aspects of Cloud usage (like security, cost and various other policy compliance) are left to the goodwill of consumers, well… that multi-account environment you have is headed for a really bad nightmare.
And this is why landing zones are essential.
An LZ helps the Cloud admins by giving them centralized management of their multi-account environment, with baselines and automations baked-in. Security and service controls for each new account created, for example, means Cloud admins will have the peace of mind knowing that consumers in every account are automatically following these security and service controls, because their creation and enforcement are automatic.
An LZ helps the Cloud consumers, too, because now they can focus on their work, instead of (for example) figuring out how to implement an encrypted, centralized Cloud audit trail so that IT Audit won't yell at them next year. They know the landing zone is already set up so that all necessary security and governance baselines are in place - with no effort on their end.
It's a win-win.

AWS Lambda (and serverless and Functions-as-a-Service (Faas), in general) is the best way to run code. Most of the operational overhead is not your responsibility (i.e., no servers to administer). What's not super obvious, though, is how to scale performance in Lambda using multithreading.
In this new serverless series, we'll dive into multithreading in AWS Lambda, looking at implementation, scaling, and even comparing multithreading vs multi-instance architectures.
Today, in part 1, I'll provide experimental data to show how multithreaded performance scales in Lambda.
TL;DR: What memory size for X number of threads?
Above is the table of summarized results from this experiment, showing at what point a Lambda function will have max performance for a certain number of threads (workers):
- One thread = 2048MB
- Two threads = 4096MB
- Three threads = 5376MB
- Four threads = 7168MB
- Five threads = 8960MB
- Six threads = 10240MB (Lambda max memory size)
Now, if you're wondering how to interpret this and how we got the data in that table, read on!
Quick refresher: AWS Lambda and core counts
While you don't have to worry about servers in Lambda, you do still have to worry about some important things (but only very lightly, far from having to actually worry about a real server). Available compute resources - in the form of compute cores and memory - is one of these things.
In AWS Lambda, while you can directly specify the amount of RAM your function will have (currently from 128MB all the way to 10240MB, in 1MB increments), you can't do the same for CPU cores.
Instead, as you increase memory, you also get a proportional amount of CPU power. IIRC, back when Lambda only had a 4GB RAM limit, there used to be an official graph in the documentation that showed you when you get an additional core. I can't find it anymore. (Maybe my Google-fu is failing; if you still know where this is, please link in the comments!)
So, here in Part 1, what we'll uncover is exactly that problem - let's figure out at what points in RAM amounts our Lambda function gets to enjoy the power of additional cores. For this, we will need a CPU-intensive load, give it varying amounts of RAM from 128MB up to 10GB, and also vary the number of workers each time (i.e., how multi-threaded it is) from 1 to 6 (6 is the current maximum number of cores you will get in a Lambda function)
The experiment: CPU-intensive load through password hashing...

Summarize the excerpt above into key points using 10 sentences or less.

Key-points:
","* AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows users to run code without worrying about servers.
* In Lambda, users can specify the amount of RAM their function will have, but not the number of CPU cores.
* As the amount of RAM increases, the function also gets a proportional amount of CPU power.
* The number of CPU cores available to a Lambda function is not directly specified by the user.
* To determine the relationship between RAM and CPU cores in Lambda, an experiment was conducted using a CPU-intensive load and varying amounts of RAM and number of workers.
* The experiment used password hashing as the CPU-intensive load.
* The results of the experiment showed that as the amount of RAM increased, the number of workers (i.e., multithreading) also increased, up to a maximum of 6 workers.
* The table provided in the excerpt summarizes the results of the experiment, showing the memory size required for a given number of workers to achieve maximum performance.
* The table shows that one worker requires 2048MB of memory, two workers require 4096MB, and so on, up to six workers requiring 10240MB (the maximum memory size available in Lambda).
* Interpreting the results of the experiment and understanding how to scale performance in Lambda using multithreading is the focus of the rest of the article."

Key-points:
","* AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows users to run code without worrying about servers.
* In Lambda, users can specify the amount of RAM their function will have, but not the number of CPU cores.
* As the amount of RAM increases, the function also gets a proportional amount of CPU power.
* The number of CPU cores available to a Lambda function is not directly specified by the user.
* To determine at what points in RAM amounts a Lambda function gets additional cores, an experiment was conducted using a CPU-intensive load and varying amounts of RAM and number of workers.
* The experiment used password hashing as the CPU-intensive load.
* The results of the experiment showed that as the number of workers increased, the performance of the function improved up to a certain point, where it leveled off.
* The memory size at which the function reached its maximum performance varied depending on the number of workers.
* A table summarizing the results of the experiment was provided, showing the memory size at which the function reached its maximum performance for different numbers of workers.

You've probably heard ""landing zones"" mentioned at some point or another if you work even just tangentially in the Cloud industry. It sounds very important, and even sort-of, kind-of military-ish. So what the heck exactly is a landing zone in the Cloud, and why should you care?
What does ""landing zone"" even mean?
In the military, a landing zone (LZ) is literally a pad or area where aircraft (especially helicopters) can land. If there is an LZ in an area, then you know that everyone being airlifted to the area will land and start at the exact same place - the LZ. It doesn't matter if we're airlifting new personnel, medical supplies, or arms and ammunition. They all land and start their life in that new area on the LZ, where we know it is secure and necessary support operations are in place.
The Cloud co-opted that terminology because it describes what we want to accomplish when it comes to scaling Cloud adoption and governance. We want every single Cloud account, across all the business units (BUs) of an organization, to start at the exact same, predefined starting point.
We want to make sure every new account follows the same baseline security guidelines and best practices, and have access to the same basic building blocks as everybody else.
How does a landing zone help me?
At their core, Cloud landing zones are a scalable and secure configuration to make complex Cloud environments (read: Enterprise-level, multi-account environments) easier to govern and, just as critically, easier to adopt.
Landing zones are meant to help two distinct general Cloud stakeholders, which we can loosely identify as ""admins"" and ""consumers"":
Admins: For those that are ultimately responsible for the administration of Cloud accounts, a landing zone approach makes it easier for them to centrally manage and govern the entirety of their multi-account environment.
Consumers: These are the general Cloud users in an organization. They might be developers who create applications in the Cloud, or they might simply be users who need to deploy specific infrastructure (VMs, storage, databases…).
Typically, consumers are interested only in consuming Cloud services. This is a problem, because that means they usually don't care about (and are also typically not trained for) security and compliance in the Cloud. So if important aspects of Cloud usage (like security, cost and various other policy compliance) are left to the goodwill of consumers, well… that multi-account environment you have is headed for a really bad nightmare.
And this is why landing zones are essential.
An LZ helps the Cloud admins by giving them centralized management of their multi-account environment, with baselines and automations baked-in. Security and service controls for each new account created, for example, means Cloud admins will have the peace of mind knowing that consumers in every account are automatically following these security and service controls, because their creation and enforcement are automatic.
An LZ helps the Cloud consumers, too, because now they can focus on their work, instead of (for example) figuring out how to implement an encrypted, centralized Cloud audit trail so that IT Audit won't yell at them next year. They know the landing zone is already set up so that all necessary security and governance baselines are in place - with no effort on their end.
It's a win-win.

AWS Lambda (and serverless and Functions-as-a-Service (Faas), in general) is the best way to run code. Most of the operational overhead is not your responsibility (i.e., no servers to administer). What's not super obvious, though, is how to scale performance in Lambda using multithreading.
In this new serverless series, we'll dive into multithreading in AWS Lambda, looking at implementation, scaling, and even comparing multithreading vs multi-instance architectures.
Today, in part 1, I'll provide experimental data to show how multithreaded performance scales in Lambda.
TL;DR: What memory size for X number of threads?
Above is the table of summarized results from this experiment, showing at what point a Lambda function will have max performance for a certain number of threads (workers):
- One thread = 2048MB
- Two threads = 4096MB
- Three threads = 5376MB
- Four threads = 7168MB
- Five threads = 8960MB
- Six threads = 10240MB (Lambda max memory size)
Now, if you're wondering how to interpret this and how we got the data in that table, read on!
Quick refresher: AWS Lambda and core counts
While you don't have to worry about servers in Lambda, you do still have to worry about some important things (but only very lightly, far from having to actually worry about a real server). Available compute resources - in the form of compute cores and memory - is one of these things.
In AWS Lambda, while you can directly specify the amount of RAM your function will have (currently from 128MB all the way to 10240MB, in 1MB increments), you can't do the same for CPU cores.
Instead, as you increase memory, you also get a proportional amount of CPU power. IIRC, back when Lambda only had a 4GB RAM limit, there used to be an official graph in the documentation that showed you when you get an additional core. I can't find it anymore. (Maybe my Google-fu is failing; if you still know where this is, please link in the comments!)
So, here in Part 1, what we'll uncover is exactly that problem - let's figure out at what points in RAM amounts our Lambda function gets to enjoy the power of additional cores.

You've probably heard ""landing zones"" mentioned at some point or another if you work even just tangentially in the Cloud industry. It sounds very important, and even sort-of, kind-of military-ish. So what the heck exactly is a landing zone in the Cloud, and why should you care?
What does ""landing zone"" even mean?
In the military, a landing zone (LZ) is literally a pad or area where aircraft (especially helicopters) can land. If there is an LZ in an area, then you know that everyone being airlifted to the area will land and start at the exact same place - the LZ. It doesn't matter if we're airlifting new personnel, medical supplies, or arms and ammunition. They all land and start their life in that new area on the LZ, where we know it is secure and necessary support operations are in place.
The Cloud co-opted that terminology because it describes what we want to accomplish when it comes to scaling Cloud adoption and governance. We want every single Cloud account, across all the business units (BUs) of an organization, to start at the exact same, predefined starting point.
We want to make sure every new account follows the same baseline security guidelines and best practices, and have access to the same basic building blocks as everybody else.
How does a landing zone help me?
At their core, Cloud landing zones are a scalable and secure configuration to make complex Cloud environments (read: Enterprise-level, multi-account environments) easier to govern and, just as critically, easier to adopt.
Landing zones are meant to help two distinct general Cloud stakeholders, which we can loosely identify as ""admins"" and ""consumers"":
Admins: For those that are ultimately responsible for the administration of Cloud accounts, a landing zone approach makes it easier for them to centrally manage and govern the entirety of their multi-account environment.
Consumers: These are the general Cloud users in an organization. They might be developers who create applications in the Cloud, or they might simply be users who need to deploy specific infrastructure (VMs, storage, databases…).
Typically, consumers are interested only in consuming Cloud services. This is a problem, because that means they usually don't care about (and are also typically not trained for) security and compliance in the Cloud. So if important aspects of Cloud usage (like security, cost and various other policy compliance) are left to the goodwill of consumers, well… that multi-account environment you have is headed for a really bad nightmare.
And this is why landing zones are essential.
An LZ helps the Cloud admins by giving them centralized management of their multi-account environment, with baselines and automations baked-in. Security and service controls for each new account created, for example, means Cloud admins will have the peace of mind knowing that consumers in every account are automatically following these security and service controls, because their creation and enforcement are automatic.
An LZ helps the Cloud consumers, too, because now they can focus on their work, instead of (for example) figuring out how to implement an encrypted, centralized Cloud audit trail so that IT Audit won't yell at them next year. They know the landing zone is already set up so that all necessary security and governance baselines are in place - with no effort on their end.
It's a win-win.

AWS Lambda (and serverless and Functions-as-a-Service (Faas), in general) is the best way to run code. Most of the operational overhead is not your responsibility (i.e., no servers to administer). What's not super obvious, though, is how to scale performance in Lambda using multithreading.
In this new serverless series, we'll dive into multithreading in AWS Lambda, looking at implementation, scaling, and even comparing multithreading vs multi-instance architectures.
Today, in part 1, I'll provide experimental data to show how multithreaded performance scales in Lambda.
TL;DR: What memory size for X number of threads?
Above is the table of summarized results from this experiment, showing at what point a Lambda function will have max performance for a certain number of threads (workers):
- One thread = 2048MB
- Two threads = 4096MB
- Three threads = 5376MB
- Four threads = 7168MB
- Five threads = 8960MB
- Six threads = 10240MB (Lambda max memory size)
Now, if you're wondering how to interpret this and how we got the data in that table, read on!
Quick refresher: AWS Lambda and core counts
While you don't have to worry about servers in Lambda, you do still have to worry about some important things (but only very lightly, far from having to actually worry about a real server). Available compute resources - in the form of compute cores and memory - is one of these things.
In AWS Lambda, while you can directly specify the amount of RAM your function will have (currently from 128MB all the way to 10240MB, in 1MB increments), you can't do the same for CPU cores.
Instead, as you increase memory, you also get a proportional amount of CPU power. IIRC, back when Lambda only had a 4GB RAM limit, there used to be an official graph in the documentation that showed you when you get an additional core. I can't find it anymore. (Maybe my Google-fu is failing; if you still know where this is, please link in the comments!)
So, here in Part 1, what we'll uncover is exactly that problem - let's figure out at what points in RAM amounts our Lambda function gets to enjoy the power of additional cores. For this, we will need a CPU-intensive load, give it varying amounts of RAM from 128MB up to 10GB, and also vary the number of workers each time (i.e., how multi-threaded it is) from 1 to 6 (6 is the current maximum number of cores you will get in a Lambda function)
The experiment: CPU-intensive load through password hashing...

1. AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service where the provider manages the infrastructure.
2. In Lambda, the user does not have to worry about servers, but they do need to consider compute resources like CPU and memory.

You've probably heard ""landing zones"" mentioned at some point or another if you work even just tangentially in the Cloud industry. It sounds very important, and even sort-of, kind-of military-ish. So what the heck exactly is a landing zone in the Cloud, and why should you care?
What does ""landing zone"" even mean?
In the military, a landing zone (LZ) is literally a pad or area where aircraft (especially helicopters) can land. If there is an LZ in an area, then you know that everyone being airlifted to the area will land and start at the exact same place - the LZ. It doesn't matter if we're airlifting new personnel, medical supplies, or arms and ammunition. They all land and start their life in that new area on the LZ, where we know it is secure and necessary support operations are in place.
The Cloud co-opted that terminology because it describes what we want to accomplish when it comes to scaling Cloud adoption and governance. We want every single Cloud account, across all the business units (BUs) of an organization, to start at the exact same, predefined starting point.
We want to make sure every new account follows the same baseline security guidelines and best practices, and have access to the same basic building blocks as everybody else.
How does a landing zone help me?
At their core, Cloud landing zones are a scalable and secure configuration to make complex Cloud environments (read: Enterprise-level, multi-account environments) easier to govern and, just as critically, easier to adopt.
Landing zones are meant to help two distinct general Cloud stakeholders, which we can loosely identify as ""admins"" and ""consumers"":
Admins: For those that are ultimately responsible for the administration of Cloud accounts, a landing zone approach makes it easier for them to centrally manage and govern the entirety of their multi-account environment.
Consumers: These are the general Cloud users in an organization. They might be developers who create applications in the Cloud, or they might simply be users who need to deploy specific infrastructure (VMs, storage, databases…).
Typically, consumers are interested only in consuming Cloud services. This is a problem, because that means they usually don't care about (and are also typically not trained for) security and compliance in the Cloud. So if important aspects of Cloud usage (like security, cost and various other policy compliance) are left to the goodwill of consumers, well… that multi-account environment you have is headed for a really bad nightmare.
And this is why landing zones are essential.
An LZ helps the Cloud admins by giving them centralized management of their multi-account environment, with baselines and automations baked-in. Security and service controls for each new account created, for example, means Cloud admins will have the peace of mind knowing that consumers in every account are automatically following these security and service controls, because their creation and enforcement are automatic.
An LZ helps the Cloud consumers, too, because now they can focus on their work, instead of (for example) figuring out how to implement an encrypted, centralized Cloud audit trail so that IT Audit won't yell at them next year. They know the landing zone is already set up so that all necessary security and governance baselines are in place - with no effort on their end.
It's a win-win.

AWS Lambda (and serverless and Functions-as-a-Service (Faas), in general) is the best way to run code. Most of the operational overhead is not your responsibility (i.e., no servers to administer). What's not super obvious, though, is how to scale performance in Lambda using multithreading.
In this new serverless series, we'll dive into multithreading in AWS Lambda, looking at implementation, scaling, and even comparing multithreading vs multi-instance architectures.
Today, in part 1, I'll provide experimental data to show how multithreaded performance scales in Lambda.
TL;DR: What memory size for X number of threads?
Above is the table of summarized results from this experiment, showing at what point a Lambda function will have max performance for a certain number of threads (workers):
- One thread = 2048MB
- Two threads = 4096MB
- Three threads = 5376MB
- Four threads = 7168MB
- Five threads = 8960MB
- Six threads = 10240MB (Lambda max memory size)
Now, if you're wondering how to interpret this and how we got the data in that table, read on!
Quick refresher: AWS Lambda and core counts
While you don't have to worry about servers in Lambda, you do still have to worry about some important things (but only very lightly, far from having to actually worry about a real server). Available compute resources - in the form of compute cores and memory - is one of these things.
In AWS Lambda, while you can directly specify the amount of RAM your function will have (currently from 128MB all the way to 10240MB, in 1MB increments), you can't do the same for CPU cores.
Instead, as you increase memory, you also get a proportional amount of CPU power. IIRC, back when Lambda only had a 4GB RAM limit, there used to be an official graph in the documentation that showed you when you get an additional core. I can't find it anymore. (Maybe my Google-fu is failing; if you still know where this is, please link in the comments!)
So, here in Part 1, what we'll uncover is exactly that problem - let's figure out at what points in RAM amounts our Lambda function gets to enjoy the power of additional cores. For this, we will need a CPU-intensive load, give it varying amounts of RAM from 128MB up to 10GB, and also vary the number of workers each time (i.e., how multi-threaded it is) from 1 to 6 (6 is the current maximum number of cores you will get in a Lambda function)
The experiment: CPU-intensive load through password hashing...

Summarize the excerpt above into key points using 10 sentences or less.

Key-points:
","* AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows users to run code without managing servers.
* In Lambda, the amount of CPU power allocated to a function is proportional to the amount of memory allocated.
* The maximum amount of memory that can be allocated to a Lambda function is 10240MB.
* The number of CPU cores available to a Lambda function increases as the amount of memory allocated increases.
* The relationship between memory allocation and CPU core allocation is not explicitly documented by AWS.
* To determine the point at which additional CPU cores are allocated, an experiment was conducted using a CPU-intensive load and varying amounts of RAM and number of workers.
* The experiment found that the number of workers (i.e., multithreading) impacts the performance of the Lambda function.
* The optimal memory size for a given number of workers was found to be: 1 thread = 2048MB, 2 threads = 4096MB, 3 threads = 5376MB, 4 threads = 7168MB, 5 threads = 8960MB, 6 threads = 10240MB.
* The results of the experiment indicate that there is a point of diminishing returns for additional threads beyond a certain memory allocation."

You've probably heard ""landing zones"" mentioned at some point or another if you work even just tangentially in the Cloud industry. It sounds very important, and even sort-of, kind-of military-ish. So what the heck exactly is a landing zone in the Cloud, and why should you care?
What does ""landing zone"" even mean?
In the military, a landing zone (LZ) is literally a pad or area where aircraft (especially helicopters) can land. If there is an LZ in an area, then you know that everyone being airlifted to the area will land and start at the exact same place - the LZ. It doesn't matter if we're airlifting new personnel, medical supplies, or arms and ammunition. They all land and start their life in that new area on the LZ, where we know it is secure and necessary support operations are in place.
The Cloud co-opted that terminology because it describes what we want to accomplish when it comes to scaling Cloud adoption and governance. We want every single Cloud account, across all the business units (BUs) of an organization, to start at the exact same, predefined starting point.
We want to make sure every new account follows the same baseline security guidelines and best practices, and have access to the same basic building blocks as everybody else.
How does a landing zone help me?
At their core, Cloud landing zones are a scalable and secure configuration to make complex Cloud environments (read: Enterprise-level, multi-account environments) easier to govern and, just as critically, easier to adopt.
Landing zones are meant to help two distinct general Cloud stakeholders, which we can loosely identify as ""admins"" and ""consumers"":
Admins: For those that are ultimately responsible for the administration of Cloud accounts, a landing zone approach makes it easier for them to centrally manage and govern the entirety of their multi-account environment.
Consumers: These are the general Cloud users in an organization. They might be developers who create applications in the Cloud, or they might simply be users who need to deploy specific infrastructure (VMs, storage, databases…).
Typically, consumers are interested only in consuming Cloud services. This is a problem, because that means they usually don't care about (and are also typically not trained for) security and compliance in the Cloud. So if important aspects of Cloud usage (like security, cost and various other policy compliance) are left to the goodwill of consumers, well… that multi-account environment you have is headed for a really bad nightmare.
And this is why landing zones are essential.
An LZ helps the Cloud admins by giving them centralized management of their multi-account environment, with baselines and automations baked-in. Security and service controls for each new account created, for example, means Cloud admins will have the peace of mind knowing that consumers in every account are automatically following these security and service controls, because their creation and enforcement are automatic.
An LZ helps the Cloud consumers, too, because now they can focus on their work, instead of (for example) figuring out how to implement an encrypted, centralized Cloud audit trail so that IT Audit won't yell at them next year. They know the landing zone is already set up so that all necessary security and governance baselines are in place - with no effort on their end.
It's a win-win.

AWS Lambda (and serverless and Functions-as-a-Service (Faas), in general) is the best way to run code. Most of the operational overhead is not your responsibility (i.e., no servers to administer). What's not super obvious, though, is how to scale performance in Lambda using multithreading.
In this new serverless series, we'll dive into multithreading in AWS Lambda, looking at implementation, scaling, and even comparing multithreading vs multi-instance architectures.
Today, in part 1, I'll provide experimental data to show how multithreaded performance scales in Lambda.
TL;DR: What memory size for X number of threads?
Above is the table of summarized results from this experiment, showing at what point a Lambda function will have max performance for a certain number of threads (workers):
- One thread = 2048MB
- Two threads = 4096MB
- Three threads = 5376MB
- Four threads = 7168MB
- Five threads = 8960MB
- Six threads = 10240MB (Lambda max memory size)
Now, if you're wondering how to interpret this and how we got the data in that table, read on!
Quick refresher: AWS Lambda and core counts
While you don't have to worry about servers in Lambda, you do still have to worry about some important things (but only very lightly, far from having to actually worry about a real server). Available compute resources - in the form of compute cores and memory - is one of these things.
In AWS Lambda, while you can directly specify the amount of RAM your function will have (currently from 128MB all the way to 10240MB, in 1MB increments), you can't do the same for CPU cores.
Instead, as you increase memory, you also get a proportional amount of CPU power. IIRC, back when Lambda only had a 4GB RAM limit, there used to be an official graph in the documentation that showed you when you get an additional core. I can't find it anymore. (Maybe my Google-fu is failing; if you still know where this is, please link in the comments!)
So, here in Part 1, what we'll uncover is exactly that problem - let's figure out at what points in RAM amounts our Lambda function gets to enjoy the power of additional cores. For this, we will need a CPU-intensive load, give it varying amounts of RAM from 128MB up to 10GB, and also vary the number of workers each time (i.e., how multi-threaded it is) from 1 to 6 (6 is the current maximum number of cores you will get in a Lambda function)
The experiment: CPU-intensive load through password hashing...

You've probably heard ""landing zones"" mentioned at some point or another if you work even just tangentially in the Cloud industry. It sounds very important, and even sort-of, kind-of military-ish. So what the heck exactly is a landing zone in the Cloud, and why should you care?
What does ""landing zone"" even mean?
In the military, a landing zone (LZ) is literally a pad or area where aircraft (especially helicopters) can land. If there is an LZ in an area, then you know that everyone being airlifted to the area will land and start at the exact same place - the LZ. It doesn't matter if we're airlifting new personnel, medical supplies, or arms and ammunition. They all land and start their life in that new area on the LZ, where we know it is secure and necessary support operations are in place.
The Cloud co-opted that terminology because it describes what we want to accomplish when it comes to scaling Cloud adoption and governance. We want every single Cloud account, across all the business units (BUs) of an organization, to start at the exact same, predefined starting point.
We want to make sure every new account follows the same baseline security guidelines and best practices, and have access to the same basic building blocks as everybody else.
How does a landing zone help me?
At their core, Cloud landing zones are a scalable and secure configuration to make complex Cloud environments (read: Enterprise-level, multi-account environments) easier to govern and, just as critically, easier to adopt.
Landing zones are meant to help two distinct general Cloud stakeholders, which we can loosely identify as ""admins"" and ""consumers"":
Admins: For those that are ultimately responsible for the administration of Cloud accounts, a landing zone approach makes it easier for them to centrally manage and govern the entirety of their multi-account environment.
Consumers: These are the general Cloud users in an organization. They might be developers who create applications in the Cloud, or they might simply be users who need to deploy specific infrastructure (VMs, storage, databases…).
Typically, consumers are interested only in consuming Cloud services. This is a problem, because that means they usually don't care about (and are also typically not trained for) security and compliance in the Cloud. So if important aspects of Cloud usage (like security, cost and various other policy compliance) are left to the goodwill of consumers, well… that multi-account environment you have is headed for a really bad nightmare.
And this is why landing zones are essential.
An LZ helps the Cloud admins by giving them centralized management of their multi-account environment, with baselines and automations baked-in. Security and service controls for each new account created, for example, means Cloud admins will have the peace of mind knowing that consumers in every account are automatically following these security and service controls, because their creation and enforcement are automatic.
An LZ helps the Cloud consumers, too, because now they can focus on their work, instead of (for example) figuring out how to implement an encrypted, centralized Cloud audit trail so that IT Audit won't yell at them next year. They know the landing zone is already set up so that all necessary security and governance baselines are in place - with no effort on their end.
It's a win-win.

Please propose 2 possible titles for the article above.

AWS Lambda (and serverless and Functions-as-a-Service (Faas), in general) is the best way to run code. Most of the operational overhead is not your responsibility (i.e., no servers to administer). What's not super obvious, though, is how to scale performance in Lambda using multithreading.
In this new serverless series, we'll dive into multithreading in AWS Lambda, looking at implementation, scaling, and even comparing multithreading vs multi-instance architectures.
Today, in part 1, I'll provide experimental data to show how multithreaded performance scales in Lambda.
TL;DR: What memory size for X number of threads?
Above is the table of summarized results from this experiment, showing at what point a Lambda function will have max performance for a certain number of threads (workers):
- One thread = 2048MB
- Two threads = 4096MB
- Three threads = 5376MB
- Four threads = 7168MB
- Five threads = 8960MB
- Six threads = 10240MB (Lambda max memory size)
Now, if you're wondering how to interpret this and how we got the data in that table, read on!
Quick refresher: AWS Lambda and core counts
While you don't have to worry about servers in Lambda, you do still have to worry about some important things (but only very lightly, far from having to actually worry about a real server). Available compute resources - in the form of compute cores and memory - is one of these things.
In AWS Lambda, while you can directly specify the amount of RAM your function will have (currently from 128MB all the way to 10240MB, in 1MB increments), you can't do the same for CPU cores.
Instead, as you increase memory, you also get a proportional amount of CPU power. IIRC, back when Lambda only had a 4GB RAM limit, there used to be an official graph in the documentation that showed you when you get an additional core. I can't find it anymore. (Maybe my Google-fu is failing; if you still know where this is, please link in the comments!)
So, here in Part 1, what we'll uncover is exactly that problem - let's figure out at what points in RAM amounts our Lambda function gets to enjoy the power of additional cores. For this, we will need a CPU-intensive load, give it varying amounts of RAM from 128MB up to 10GB, and also vary the number of workers each time (i.e., how multi-threaded it is) from 1 to 6 (6 is the current maximum number of cores you will get in a Lambda function)
The experiment: CPU-intensive load through password hashing...

Summarize the excerpt above into key points using 10 sentences or less.

Key-points:
","* AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows users to run code without worrying about servers.
* In Lambda, users can specify the amount of RAM their function will have, but not the number of CPU cores.
* As the amount of RAM increases, the function also gets a proportional amount of CPU power.
* The number of CPU cores available to a Lambda function is determined by the amount of RAM allocated to the function.
* The author of the article conducted an experiment to determine at what points in RAM amounts a Lambda function gets to enjoy the power of additional cores.
* The experiment used a CPU-intensive load through password hashing to test the performance of the function at different RAM allocations and thread counts.
* The results of the experiment showed that the function's performance scales well with the number of threads up to a certain point, after which it plateaus.
* The memory size at which the function reaches its maximum performance varies depending on the number of threads.
* The author provided a table summarizing the results of the experiment, showing the memory size required for maximum performance at different thread counts.
* The table shows that the function's performance scales well with the number of threads up to 5 threads, after which it plateaus."

You've probably heard ""landing zones"" mentioned at some point or another if you work even just tangentially in the Cloud industry. It sounds very important, and even sort-of, kind-of military-ish. So what the heck exactly is a landing zone in the Cloud, and why should you care?
What does ""landing zone"" even mean?
In the military, a landing zone (LZ) is literally a pad or area where aircraft (especially helicopters) can land. If there is an LZ in an area, then you know that everyone being airlifted to the area will land and start at the exact same place - the LZ. It doesn't matter if we're airlifting new personnel, medical supplies, or arms and ammunition. They all land and start their life in that new area on the LZ, where we know it is secure and necessary support operations are in place.
The Cloud co-opted that terminology because it describes what we want to accomplish when it comes to scaling Cloud adoption and governance. We want every single Cloud account, across all the business units (BUs) of an organization, to start at the exact same, predefined starting point.
We want to make sure every new account follows the same baseline security guidelines and best practices, and have access to the same basic building blocks as everybody else.
How does a landing zone help me?
At their core, Cloud landing zones are a scalable and secure configuration to make complex Cloud environments (read: Enterprise-level, multi-account environments) easier to govern and, just as critically, easier to adopt.
Landing zones are meant to help two distinct general Cloud stakeholders, which we can loosely identify as ""admins"" and ""consumers"":
Admins: For those that are ultimately responsible for the administration of Cloud accounts, a landing zone approach makes it easier for them to centrally manage and govern the entirety of their multi-account environment.
Consumers: These are the general Cloud users in an organization. They might be developers who create applications in the Cloud, or they might simply be users who need to deploy specific infrastructure (VMs, storage, databases…).
Typically, consumers are interested only in consuming Cloud services. This is a problem, because that means they usually don't care about (and are also typically not trained for) security and compliance in the Cloud. So if important aspects of Cloud usage (like security, cost and various other policy compliance) are left to the goodwill of consumers, well… that multi-account environment you have is headed for a really bad nightmare.
And this is why landing zones are essential.
An LZ helps the Cloud admins by giving them centralized management of their multi-account environment, with baselines and automations baked-in. Security and service controls for each new account created, for example, means Cloud admins will have the peace of mind knowing that consumers in every account are automatically following these security and service controls, because their creation and enforcement are automatic.
An LZ helps the Cloud consumers, too, because now they can focus on their work, instead of (for example) figuring out how to implement an encrypted, centralized Cloud audit trail so that IT Audit won't yell at them next year. They know the landing zone is already set up so that all necessary security and governance baselines are in place - with no effort on their end.
It's a win-win.

AWS Lambda (and serverless and Functions-as-a-Service (Faas), in general) is the best way to run code. Most of the operational overhead is not your responsibility (i.e., no servers to administer). What's not super obvious, though, is how to scale performance in Lambda using multithreading.
In this new serverless series, we'll dive into multithreading in AWS Lambda, looking at implementation, scaling, and even comparing multithreading vs multi-instance architectures.
Today, in part 1, I'll provide experimental data to show how multithreaded performance scales in Lambda.
TL;DR: What memory size for X number of threads?
Above is the table of summarized results from this experiment, showing at what point a Lambda function will have max performance for a certain number of threads (workers):
- One thread = 2048MB
- Two threads = 4096MB
- Three threads = 5376MB
- Four threads = 7168MB
- Five threads = 8960MB
- Six threads = 10240MB (Lambda max memory size)
Now, if you're wondering how to interpret this and how we got the data in that table, read on!
Quick refresher: AWS Lambda and core counts
While you don't have to worry about servers in Lambda, you do still have to worry about some important things (but only very lightly, far from having to actually worry about a real server). Available compute resources - in the form of compute cores and memory - is one of these things.
In AWS Lambda, while you can directly specify the amount of RAM your function will have (currently from 128MB all the way to 10240MB, in 1MB increments), you can't do the same for CPU cores.
Instead, as you increase memory, you also get a proportional amount of CPU power. IIRC, back when Lambda only had a 4GB RAM limit, there used to be an official graph in the documentation that showed you when you get an additional core. I can't find it anymore. (Maybe my Google-fu is failing; if you still know where this is, please link in the comments!)
So, here in Part 1, what we'll uncover is exactly that problem - let's figure out at what points in RAM amounts our Lambda function gets to enjoy the power of additional cores. For this, we will need a CPU-intensive load, give it varying amounts of RAM from 128MB up to 10GB, and also vary the number of workers each time (i.e., how multi-threaded it is) from 1 to 6 (6 is the current maximum number of cores you will get in a Lambda function)
The experiment: CPU-intensive load through password hashing...

Summarize the excerpt above into key points using 10 sentences or less.

Key-points:
","Sure! Here are the key points from the excerpt:

1. AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows developers to run code without worrying about servers.
2. In Lambda, the amount of CPU power and memory available to a function is proportional to the amount of memory specified.
3. The maximum amount of memory available in Lambda is 10240MB.
4. The number of CPU cores available to a Lambda function increases as the amount of memory specified increases.
5. The relationship between memory and CPU cores in Lambda is not explicitly defined in the documentation.
6. To determine the points at which a Lambda function gets additional CPU cores, an experiment was conducted using a CPU-intensive load and varying amounts of RAM and workers.

Response:
","As a Cloud Solutions Architect, I understand the importance of digital transformation and becoming a data-driven organization. AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) is a powerful tool that can help you achieve these goals. Here are the most important features and functionalities of S3 that will resonate with your concerns:

1. Scalability: S3 is designed to handle large amounts of data and scale with your growing needs. You can store petabytes of data in a single S3 bucket, and the service can handle millions of requests per second. This means you can store and process massive amounts of data without worrying about running out of space or performance issues.
2. Data Availability: S3 provides high availability and durability features to ensure your data is always accessible. The service stores data across multiple servers and availability zones, which means that even if one server or zone goes down, your data will still be accessible. Additionally, S3 offers redundant storage options, such as storing data in multiple formats or storing redundant copies of data in different locations.
3. Data Security: S3 provides robust security features to protect your data. You can configure access controls and permissions to ensure that only authorized users can access your data. Additionally, S3 supports encryption for data in transit and at rest, which means your data is protected from unauthorized access even if it's intercepted or stolen.
4. Data Analytics: S3 provides features that make it easy to analyze and process large amounts of data. You can use Amazon S3 Select to run SQL-like queries on your data without having to move it, and Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration to speed up the transfer of large data sets. Additionally, S3 integrates with other AWS services like Amazon Redshift, Amazon Athena, and Amazon Lambda, which can help you process, analyze, and visualize your data.
5. Machine Learning: S3 provides features that make it easy to use machine learning algorithms to analyze and process your data. You can use Amazon SageMaker to train and deploy machine learning models, and Amazon Rekognition to analyze images and videos stored in S3. Additionally, S3 integrates with other AWS machine learning services like Amazon Comprehend and Amazon Personalize, which can help you extract insights and recommendations from your data.
6. Integration: S3 integrates with a wide range of AWS services, including"

You are an expert Cloud Solutions Architect addressing a customer CTO about Amazon DynamoDB. Craft a convincing argument for why the CTO should consider using DynamoDB as the backend of their next major software development project. Be concise and limit your response to 400 words or less.

Response:


","Hello, esteemed CTO! I'm thrilled to introduce you to Amazon DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database service that can help your organization achieve unparalleled scalability, performance, and cost savings. As a seasoned Cloud Solutions Architect, I'm confident that DynamoDB can be the backend of your next major software development project. Here's why:

1. Scalability: DynamoDB can handle massive amounts of data and scale seamlessly to accommodate your project's growth. With DynamoDB, you can effortlessly handle high traffic and large user bases without worrying about capacity planning or infrastructure management.
2. Performance: DynamoDB is designed for high-performance data storage and retrieval. It uses a proprietary storage system that combines in-memory caching, solid-state drives, and hard disk drives to deliver fast read and write operations. Additionally, DynamoDB supports automatic partitioning, which ensures that your data is distributed evenly across multiple servers, further optimizing performance.
3. Cost-effectiveness: DynamoDB offers a cost-effective solution by allowing you to only pay for the capacity you use. This means you can avoid the upfront costs and complexity of managing a traditional relational database. Moreover, DynamoDB provides flexible pricing options, such as on-demand and reserved capacity, to further optimize your costs.
4. Security: DynamoDB takes security seriously, providing encryption at rest and in transit, granular access controls, and auditing features to ensure your data is safe and secure. You can also use AWS IAM to manage access to your DynamoDB tables, making it easy to integrate with your existing security infrastructure.
5. Integration: DynamoDB integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, and Amazon Redshift. This allows you to create a robust, end-to-end solution for your software development project.
6. Low Maintenance: DynamoDB is a fully managed service, which means AWS handles the underlying infrastructure and maintenance tasks, such as patch management, backups, and upgrades. This allows your team to focus on developing innovative features and delivering value to your customers, rather than managing database infrastructure.
7. Massive Community Support: DynamoDB has a large and active community of developers,"

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together. Overall, I highly recommend the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together. Overall, I highly recommend the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home.

I bought the Zen End Table and I have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the design is sleek and modern, which complements my living room aesthetic. However, the quality is not up to par. The table arrived with a few scratches and the wood feels a bit flimsy. For the price I paid, I expected better craftsmanship. Overall, I would give it 3 stars.

I am extremely disappointed with the Vintage Elegance Vanity. The quality of the product is very poor and does not meet my expectations at all. The materials used feel cheap and the vanity arrived with several scratches and dents. The assembly instructions were also confusing and the whole process took much longer than anticipated.

I bought the Zen End Table and I have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the design is sleek and modern, which complements my living room aesthetic. However, the quality is not up to par. The table arrived with a few scratches and the wood feels a bit flimsy. For the price I paid, I expected better craftsmanship. Overall, I would give it 3 stars.

I recently purchased the Bliss Rocking Chair and I am absolutely in love with it! The chair is not only beautiful, but also incredibly comfortable. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, making it perfect for relaxing after a long day. The craftsmanship is top-notch, with sturdy construction and high-quality materials. I also appreciate the attention to detail in the design, such as the curved armrests and the ergonomic backrest. Overall, I highly recommend the Bliss Rocking Chair to anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home. It truly brings joy and relaxation to my life!

I am extremely disappointed with this wardrobe. The quality of the materials used is very poor and the construction feels flimsy. The doors do not close properly and the hinges are already coming loose after just a few weeks of use. I expected much better for the price I paid. Would not recommend it.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together.

I am extremely disappointed with the Vintage Elegance Vanity. The quality of the product is very poor and does not meet my expectations at all. The materials used feel cheap and the vanity arrived with several scratches and dents. The assembly instructions were also confusing and the whole process took much longer than anticipated. I would not recommend this product to anyone.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together. Overall, I highly recommend the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home.

I am extremely disappointed with this wardrobe. The quality of the materials used is very poor and the construction feels flimsy. The doors do not close properly and the hinges are already coming loose after just a few weeks of use. I expected much better for the price I paid. Would not recommend it.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together. Overall, I highly recommend the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together. Overall, I highly recommend the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home.

I bought the Zen End Table and I have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the design is sleek and modern, which complements my living room aesthetic. However, the quality is not up to par. The table arrived with a few scratches and the wood feels a bit flimsy. For the price I paid, I expected better craftsmanship. Overall, I would give it 3 stars.

I bought the Zen End Table and I have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the design is sleek and modern, which complements my living room aesthetic. However, the quality is not up to par. The table arrived with a few scratches and the wood feels a bit flimsy. For the price I paid, I expected better craftsmanship. Overall, I would give it 3 stars.

I recently purchased the Bliss Rocking Chair and I am absolutely in love with it! The chair is not only beautiful, but also incredibly comfortable. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, making it perfect for relaxing after a long day. The craftsmanship is top-notch, with sturdy construction and high-quality materials. I also appreciate the attention to detail in the design, such as the curved armrests and the ergonomic backrest. Overall, I highly recommend the Bliss Rocking Chair to anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home. It truly brings joy and relaxation to my life!

I am extremely disappointed with this wardrobe. The quality of the materials used is very poor and the construction feels flimsy. The doors do not close properly and the hinges are already coming loose after just a few weeks of use. I expected much better for the price I paid. Would not recommend it.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together. Overall, I highly recommend the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home.

The materials used feel cheap and the vanity arrived with several scratches and dents. The assembly instructions were also confusing and the whole process took much longer than anticipated. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
```

I am extremely disappointed with this wardrobe. The quality of the materials used is very poor and the construction feels flimsy. The doors do not close properly and the hinges are already coming loose after just a few weeks of use. I expected much better for the price I paid. Would not recommend it.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together. Overall, I highly recommend the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home.

I bought the Zen End Table and I have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the design is sleek and modern, which complements my living room aesthetic. However, the quality is not up to par. The table arrived with a few scratches and the wood feels a bit flimsy. For the price I paid, I expected better craftsmanship. Overall, I would give it 3 stars.

I am extremely disappointed with the Vintage Elegance Vanity. The quality of the product is very poor and does not meet my expectations at all. The materials used feel cheap and the vanity arrived with several scratches and dents. The assembly instructions were also confusing and the whole process took much longer than anticipated. I would not recommend this product to anyone.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together. Overall, I highly recommend the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home.

I bought the Zen End Table and I have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the design is sleek and modern, which complements my living room aesthetic. However, the quality is not up to par. The table arrived with a few scratches and the wood feels a bit flimsy. For the price I paid, I expected better craftsmanship. Overall, I would give it 3 stars.

I am extremely disappointed with the Vintage Elegance Vanity. The quality of the product is very poor and does not meet my expectations at all. The materials used feel cheap and the vanity arrived with several scratches and dents. The assembly instructions were also confusing and the whole process took much longer than anticipated. I would not recommend this product to anyone.

I am extremely disappointed with this wardrobe. The quality of the materials used is very poor and the construction feels flimsy. The doors do not close properly and the hinges are already coming loose after just a few weeks of use. I expected much better for the price I paid. Would not recommend it.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together.

I am extremely disappointed with the Vintage Elegance Vanity. The quality of the product is very poor and does not meet my expectations at all. The materials used feel cheap and the vanity arrived with several scratches and dents. The assembly instructions were also confusing and the whole process took much longer than anticipated. I would not recommend this product to anyone.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together. Overall, I highly recommend the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home.

I am extremely disappointed with this wardrobe. The quality of the materials used is very poor and the construction feels flimsy. The doors do not close properly and the hinges are already coming loose after just a few weeks of use. I expected much better for the price I paid. Would not recommend it.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together. Overall, I highly recommend the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together. Overall, I highly recommend the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home.

I bought the Zen End Table and I have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the design is sleek and modern, which complements my living room aesthetic. However, the quality is not up to par. The table arrived with a few scratches and the wood feels a bit flimsy. For the price I paid, I expected better craftsmanship. Overall, I would give it 3 stars.

I bought the Zen End Table and I have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the design is sleek and modern, which complements my living room aesthetic. However, the quality is not up to par. The table arrived with a few scratches and the wood feels a bit flimsy. For the price I paid, I expected better craftsmanship. Overall, I would give it 3 stars.

I recently purchased the Bliss Rocking Chair and I am absolutely in love with it! The chair is not only beautiful, but also incredibly comfortable. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, making it perfect for relaxing after a long day. The craftsmanship is top-notch, with sturdy construction and high-quality materials. I also appreciate the attention to detail in the design, such as the curved armrests and the ergonomic backrest. Overall, I highly recommend the Bliss Rocking Chair to anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home. It truly brings joy and relaxation to my life!

I am extremely disappointed with this wardrobe. The quality of the materials used is very poor and the construction feels flimsy. The doors do not close properly and the hinges are already coming loose after just a few weeks of use. I expected much better for the price I paid. Would not recommend it.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together. Overall, I highly recommend the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home.

I am extremely disappointed with the Vintage Elegance Vanity. The quality of the product is very poor and does not meet my expectations at all. The materials used feel cheap and the vanity arrived with several scratches and dents. The assembly instructions were also confusing and the whole process took much longer than anticipated. I would not recommend this product to anyone.

I am extremely disappointed with this wardrobe. The quality of the materials used is very poor and the construction feels flimsy. The doors do not close properly and the hinges are already coming loose after just a few weeks of use. I expected much better for the price I paid. Would not recommend it.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together. Overall, I highly recommend the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home.

I bought the Zen End Table and I have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the design is sleek and modern, which complements my living room aesthetic. However, the quality is not up to par.

I am extremely disappointed with the Vintage Elegance Vanity. The quality of the product is very poor and does not meet my expectations at all. The materials used feel cheap and the vanity arrived with several scratches and dents. The assembly instructions were also confusing and the whole process took much longer than anticipated. I would not recommend this product to anyone.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together. Overall, I highly recommend the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home.

I am extremely disappointed with this wardrobe. The quality of the materials used is very poor and the construction feels flimsy. The doors do not close properly and the hinges are already coming loose after just a few weeks of use. I expected much better for the price I paid. Would not recommend it.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together.

I bought the Zen End Table and I have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the design is sleek and modern, which complements my living room aesthetic. However, the quality is not up to par. The table arrived with a few scratches and the wood feels a bit flimsy. For the price I paid, I expected better craftsmanship. Overall, I would give it 3 stars.

I am extremely disappointed with the Vintage Elegance Vanity. The quality of the product is very poor and does not meet my expectations at all. The materials used feel cheap and the vanity arrived with several scratches and dents. The assembly instructions were also confusing and the whole process took much longer than anticipated. I would not recommend this product to anyone.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together. Overall, I highly recommend the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home.

I am extremely disappointed with this wardrobe. The quality of the materials used is very poor and the construction feels flimsy. The doors do not close properly and the hinges are already coming loose after just a few weeks of use. I expected much better for the price I paid. Would not recommend it.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together. Overall, I highly recommend the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together. Overall, I highly recommend the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home.

I bought the Zen End Table and I have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the design is sleek and modern, which complements my living room aesthetic. However, the quality is not up to par. The table arrived with a few scratches and the wood feels a bit flimsy. For the price I paid, I expected better craftsmanship. Overall, I would give it 3 stars.

The table arrived with a few scratches and the wood feels a bit flimsy. For the price I paid, I expected better craftsmanship. Overall, I would give it 3 stars.

I recently purchased the Bliss Rocking Chair and I am absolutely in love with it! The chair is not only beautiful, but also incredibly comfortable. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, making it perfect for relaxing after a long day. The craftsmanship is top-notch, with sturdy construction and high-quality materials. I also appreciate the attention to detail in the design, such as the curved armrests and the ergonomic backrest. Overall, I highly recommend the Bliss Rocking Chair to anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home. It truly brings joy and relaxation to my life!

I am extremely disappointed with this wardrobe. The quality of the materials used is very poor and the construction feels flimsy. The doors do not close properly and the hinges are already coming loose after just a few weeks of use. I expected much better for the price I paid. Would not recommend it.

I recently bought the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair and I must say that I am quite impressed. The design and craftsmanship are top-notch. The chair is incredibly comfortable and provides excellent support for my back. The rocking motion is smooth and soothing, perfect for relaxation after a long day. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because the assembly instructions were a bit unclear and it took me longer than expected to put it together. Overall, I highly recommend the Scandinavian Serenity Rocking Chair for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their home.
